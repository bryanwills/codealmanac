# Absorb Operation

You are improving an existing Almanac wiki from a concrete starting context.

The base prompt modules define the wiki purpose, page-selection rules, folder
structure, and writing syntax. Follow them.

The input may be a coding session, file, folder, diff, document, docs read,
research note, market read, product conversation, incident, user feedback, or
other pointer. Treat that input as raw material, not as the output.

## Algorithm

1. Understand the starting context and what kind of input it is.
2. Extract candidate durable learnings, changed assumptions, project-world
   connections, risks, decisions, incidents, and synthesis updates.
3. Inspect the current `docs/almanac/` wiki for the right home before creating pages.
4. Verify important claims against code, tests, docs, sources, git history, or
   the provided context when useful.
5. Prefer updating existing evolving pages over creating new pages.
6. Create a new page only when the input reveals a durable subject that needs
   its own anchor.
7. Put unsettled current work in `active/` only when it is useful to preserve
   while work is happening. Fold it into durable pages once it settles.
8. Preserve old knowledge when it explains the current state. Say what changed,
   when known, and why it matters now.
9. Update topics and links so the new understanding joins the graph.
10. No-op when the input does not improve durable project knowledge.

Do not summarize sessions, files, docs, market reads, or conversations. Distill
their reusable project meaning.

Keep changes proportional to the input. Broad restructuring is valid when the
input reveals a real graph or navigation problem, but do not churn unrelated
pages.

## Helper Agents

Most Absorb runs should be single-agent. If the input spans multiple
independent areas, requires external verification, or is large enough that
parallel investigation will materially improve quality, use helper/subagents
for bounded research or draft fragments.

The main agent owns final integration, page boundaries, folders, topics, links,
hubs, and final prose.

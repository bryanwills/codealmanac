# Next Agent Brief

Updated: 2026-07-01

## Current State

- The earlier Python local-product implementation goal reached public-beta
  package proof in slice 71, but the active goal now reopens architecture
  quality work before release: keep applying Cosmic Python, `MANUAL.md`, and
  useful `../almanac` patterns until further cleanup is genuinely diminishing
  returns.
- Branch: `dev`.
- Latest implementation slice: slice 80 setup terminal renderer.
- Live contract: `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`.
- Public release gate: `docs/python-port/public-release-readiness.md`.
- Public beta audit: `docs/python-port/public-beta-gate-audit.md`.
- Cosmic Python local guide: `docs/reference/cosmic-python/CODEALMANAC.md`.
- Latest verified source-runtime direction: selected local material becomes
  `SourceAddress -> SourceRef -> SourceBrief -> SourceRuntime` before Ingest
  calls a harness.
- Current Python product surface includes CLI/app composition, workspace
  registry, configurable Almanac root, SQLite read model, search/show/topics/health,
  tag/untag/topic mutation, reindex, doctor, serve, runs/jobs, ingest, garden,
  foreground sync, sync status, local automation, Codex/Claude harness adapters,
  transcript discovery, source runtime adapters, bundled manual resources
  materialized into `<almanac-root>/manual/`, and a conservative package update
  command.
- There is no public or hidden cloud capture surface. `codealmanac update`
  updates the installed CLI package only. `sync` scans local transcripts and
  runs local ingest. `automation` schedules local `sync`/`garden`.
  `capture`, cloud upload, hosted connection, and login remain outside Python
  v1.
- `codealmanac update` is dogfooded from non-editable pip and uv-tool installs.
  Successful package-manager execution reports status `completed`, not
  `updated`, because package-manager output may say no files changed and the
  service does not scrape prose for stronger semantics.
- Slice 41 implements the configured-root decision: new repos default to
  `almanac/`; `docs/almanac/` is the public alternate repo shape. The registry
  stores `almanac_root`, `Workspace` exposes `almanac_path`, project config
  lives under `<almanac-root>/config.toml`, run logs and sync ledgers live under
  `<almanac-root>/jobs/`, and prompts/manual text refers to the configured
  Almanac root.
- Slice 70 moves default user/global state to `~/.codealmanac/`. The repo-local
  wiki root remains `almanac/`; registry, user config, and automation logs now
  use the product-specific hidden directory.
- Slice 71 reran current-head package proof after the slice 70 state-path and
  README changes. Fresh wheel and sdist artifacts passed `twine check`,
  metadata/package-data inspection, clean Python 3.12.9 installs, installed CLI
  smoke, live `serve` HTTP checks, and explicit `~/.codealmanac/registry.json`
  state-path assertions.
- Slice 42 completes the configured-root source-runtime follow-through:
  Ingest passes `workspace.almanac_root` through `SourceRuntimeContext`, and
  filesystem directory runtime applies that context for both Git listing and
  Python/pathspec walking. The adapter no longer hard-codes Almanac root names.
- The local viewer now exposes `/api/file?path=...` and frontend
  `#/file/<path>` for wiki file/folder reference navigation. It lists pages
  mentioning the reference and does not read repo source contents.
- Viewer Markdown rendering uses `markdown-it-py` token streams. Wikilink
  rewriting touches inline text tokens only; inline code and fenced code remain
  source text, and link labels are escaped by the renderer.
- `serve` now borrows UseAlmanac's alpine dashboard visual language but keeps
  CodeAlmanac's local wiki IA. Preserve the sidebar/page graph/search/topic/file
  navigation model; do not copy UseAlmanac's hosted wiki page-list/search flow,
  hosted account routes, billing/settings surfaces, or hosted wording. The
  current UseAlmanac wiki page/search UX is a non-target reference. The desired
  shape is the earlier CodeAlmanac sidebar-first local viewer with better visual
  treatment layered over it.
- Slice 51 is a narrow `serve` shell polish pass:
  repo-owned wiki rail wording, `Local knowledge graph` scope text, active
  page/topic rail links from hash-route metadata, mobile rail density cleanup,
  and a CSS guard against viewport-scaled type. Browser-harness visual dogfood
  passed through an isolated temporary Chrome profile with explicit `BU_CDP_URL`;
  default-profile Chrome still requires the manual remote-debugging Allow click.
- Bulletproof React Markdown reference lives under
  `docs/reference/bulletproof-react/`. Treat it as frontend architecture
  guidance for future viewer growth, not a reason to add React/Next.js while
  the static package-data viewer remains maintainable.
- The served frontend now uses static ES modules. `app.js` imports
  `/assets/viewer/main.js`; nested modules split API calls, routes, shared DOM
  components, and screen renderers. The server validates nested static asset
  paths before serving them.
- Structured page `sources:` are now part of the SQLite read model. The indexer
  parses supported page provenance types, projects `page_sources`, derives
  file refs from `sources[type=file]`, exposes sources through `show --meta`,
  `show --json`, and viewer page APIs, and reports missing citations, unused
  sources, and duplicate source ids through health. This is page evidence,
  not the source-runtime input model.
- Slice 79 restores the first setup/uninstall layer. `SetupService` owns
  setup/uninstall requests and results; `integrations/setup` installs/removes
  Codex and Claude instruction artifacts behind `InstructionInstaller`.
  `codealmanac setup --yes --target codex|claude|all` installs a current
  `codealmanac` managed instruction block or Claude guide/import. `codealmanac
  uninstall --yes --target ...` removes only those setup-owned artifacts.
  Remaining setup work is terminal UX, target selection UI, default agent/model
  selection, and local automation choices.
- Slice 80 improves setup/uninstall terminal output through Rich under the CLI
  render edge. Services still return Pydantic result facts; only
  `cli/render/setup.py` imports Rich. Text setup output now has a branded panel,
  status rows, and an explicit next-steps box that suggests manual automation
  separately from setup. JSON output remains unchanged.
- Source runtime covers filesystem paths, Git, GitHub, transcripts, and web
  URLs behind `services/sources/ports.py::SourceRuntimeAdapter`.
  `InspectSourceRuntimeRequest.context` carries workflow-owned runtime policy
  such as ignored workspace directories.
- `codealmanac.database` owns SQLite connection setup and migration
  application. `IndexStore` owns the first typed store migration for the
  derived `index.db` read model. `services/index/views.py` owns read-only
  query SQL and row-to-Pydantic view construction for search, page/topic reads,
  and health.
- `services/config` owns local TOML config parsing and precedence. Project
  config is `<almanac-root>/config.toml`; CLI flags still win over config. It
  uses `pydantic-settings` TOML sources.
  The first supported fields are `[harness].default` and `[sync].quiet`.
- Slice 40 splits the CLI edge: `main.py` is thin, parser construction is under
  `cli/parser/` by command domain, and dispatch/render moved to
  `cli/dispatch/root.py` and `cli/render/root.py`.
- Slice 49 splits the admin CLI edge. `doctor`, `update`, `jobs`, and
  `automation` live under `cli/dispatch/admin.py` and `cli/render/admin.py`;
  shared CLI config/duration resolution lives in `cli/dispatch/config.py`.
- Slice 72 splits the rest of CLI dispatch by domain. `cli/dispatch/root.py` is
  a small delegator; lifecycle commands live in `cli/dispatch/lifecycle.py`;
  wiki/read commands live in `cli/dispatch/wiki.py`; architecture tests guard
  the root size and dispatch file size.
- Slice 73 extracts the shared page-writing lifecycle into
  `workflows/page_run/`. `IngestWorkflow` and `GardenWorkflow` keep
  operation-specific context and prompt preparation; `PageRunWorkflow` owns
  running-state transition, mutation preflight, harness calls, transcript/event
  recording, mutation validation, index refresh, terminal success, and failure
  recording. Architecture tests now prevent ingest/garden from importing the
  shared harness/run plumbing directly.
- Slice 74 restores the first jobs control surface in Python:
  `codealmanac jobs attach <run-id>` replays the durable run log and reports the
  current status, `codealmanac jobs cancel <run-id>` marks queued/running runs
  cancelled through `RunsService`, and `RunStore.finish(...)` preserves an
  already-cancelled record instead of resurrecting it as done or failed. This
  is the control seam the future queue/worker will use; it does not yet spawn
  background workers.
- Slice 75 restores the in-process background queue core. `RunsService.queue`
  persists executable `<run-id>.spec.json` files beside run records,
  `next_queued` selects the oldest queued run that has a spec, and per-wiki
  `worker.lock/owner.json` serializes worker drains with stale-lock recovery.
  `RunQueueWorkflow` dispatches persisted Ingest/Garden specs back through the
  existing operation workflows, so prompt construction, mutation preflight,
  harness execution, index refresh, and terminal state still live in the
  lifecycle path. Detached process spawning and public foreground/background
  lifecycle flags are still missing.
- Slice 76 exposes the queue core through explicit background lifecycle mode.
  `ingest --background` and `garden --background` enqueue a spec-backed run and
  spawn a detached worker through an injected spawner port. The real adapter
  runs `sys.executable -m codealmanac.cli.main __run-worker --cwd <repo>`;
  the hidden worker command drains through `RunQueueWorkflow`, so it remains an
  entrypoint rather than an internal API. Plain `ingest` and `garden` still run
  foreground until the default-mode product decision is made explicitly. Sync
  still runs foreground ingest in-process.
- Slice 77 adds explicit background sync mode. `sync --background` keeps sync
  responsible for transcript discovery, cursor decisions, and pending ledger
  claims, then queues an Ingest spec through `RunQueueWorkflow`, saves the
  pending claim linked to the queued run id, and only then spawns a worker.
  Plain `sync` remains foreground, and local automation still schedules
  foreground sync until unattended background policy is reopened.
- Slice 78 restores structured page source readback in the Python index. Page
  frontmatter remains canonical, `PageSource` is normalized before SQLite,
  `page_sources` is a derived projection, and source-health warnings stay
  report-only. No migration command, source catalog, or web snapshot machinery
  was added.
- Filesystem directory runtime uses Git listing inside worktrees, then falls
  back to the bounded Python/pathspec walk outside Git.
- Directory runtime ranks changed and untracked files before unchanged files,
  interleaves clean directory groups, prefers role-bearing files, and labels
  included files as `changed` or `unchanged`.
- Public-contract tests guard the local-only CLI/package surface: only the
  `codealmanac` script, no hosted verbs, no compatibility aliases, and no
  `sdk` or `mcp` package modules. They also guard README/package metadata so
  old Node/npm, `almanac`, hosted-dashboard, and `absorb` language does not
  return.
- `README.md` now documents the Python local product surface: Python 3.12+,
  `codealmanac`, default `almanac/`, local install, local read commands,
  lifecycle commands, sync, automation, jobs, providers, configuration, and the
  no-hosted/no-alias public contract.
- Slice 57 real Codex ingest dogfood passed through `IngestWorkflow` and
  `CodexCliHarnessAdapter` in isolated temp repos. The first run exposed broken
  page links from over-eager entity wikilinking; prompt/manual guidance now
  says page links must resolve. A second real Codex run on the same source
  shape produced a page with no broken links. Starter scaffold topics were
  narrowed so fresh init no longer creates empty-topic health noise.
- Slice 58 real Claude ingest dogfood passed through `IngestWorkflow` and
  `ClaudeCliHarnessAdapter` in an isolated temp repo. It created
  `incident-window-policy.md`, updated `topics.yaml`, preserved mutation safety,
  produced readable `jobs logs`, and left `health --json` clean. Public CLI
  readback worked for jobs logs, search, show, and health. No code or prompt
  patch was needed.
- Slice 59 real sync dogfood passed against a temp Codex transcript and real
  Claude-backed Ingest. Sync discovered one ready transcript, started
  `ingest-20260629231810-40e74df3`, advanced the ledger to `done`, skipped the
  same transcript as `unchanged` on the second status run, produced
  `sync-workflow.md`, and left health clean. Public CLI readback worked for
  `sync status`, `jobs logs`, `jobs show`, `search`, `show`, and
  `health --json` when selected with `uv run --project` because the branch is
  not published yet.
- Slice 60 serve browser proof passed through browser-harness against a live
  temp `serve` instance. The desktop routes `/`, `#/page/auth-flow`,
  `#/topic/auth`, `#/search/auth`, and `#/file/src/auth/session.py` rendered the
  expected headings/content with no horizontal overflow. A 390px mobile
  `#/page/auth-flow` route also rendered page content and file refs with no
  horizontal overflow. No viewer code or CSS patch was needed.
- Slice 61 final package rehearsal passed from built artifacts. Wheel and
  sdist builds installed into clean Python 3.12.9 environments, installed CLI
  smoke passed for `init`, `search`, `show`, `topics`, `health`, `jobs`,
  `sync status`, `doctor`, and `serve`, and a Python 3.11 install failed as
  intended because the package requires `>=3.12`. Package metadata now uses
  SPDX `Apache-2.0` plus `license-files = ["LICENSE.md"]`.
- Slice 62 replaced the stale npm release guide with the Python/PyPI release
  guide, added PyPI-facing package metadata, and extended public-contract tests
  to reject old npm release commands. Current setuptools rejects license
  classifiers when SPDX `license = "Apache-2.0"` is present, so package
  classifiers intentionally omit `License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software
  License`.
- The manual surface is a support package, not a public command. `ManualLibrary`
  reads `src/codealmanac/manual/*.md`, `build`/`init` copy missing docs into
  the configured root's `manual/`, prompts tell lifecycle agents to read those
  docs, and `doctor` checks package/workspace manual readiness. Slice 52 adds
  drift diagnostics: complete manual files that differ from bundled docs are
  reported as informational review work, not overwritten by build/init.
- `codealmanac list` is the local registry management surface. Plain `list`
  keeps the three-column output; `list --json` reports registry availability;
  `list --drop <selector>` removes one explicit entry; `list --drop-missing`
  explicitly removes unreachable entries. Read commands do not prune registry
  state silently.
- Page-writing lifecycle workflows record normalized harness events before
  later validation. `PageRunWorkflow` writes returned `HarnessEvent` values as
  soon as the harness returns, so failed harness runs remain visible in
  `jobs logs` even when the terminal run error is a mutation-safety failure.
  Current Codex and Claude CLI adapters emit terminal `done` events only; the
  active rewrite goal still needs the richer Codex app-server and Claude
  SDK/event harness model before the harness contract is genuinely restored.
- Foreground `sync` writes a durable pending ledger claim before invoking
  Ingest, skips active pending transcript ranges, reports stale pending ranges
  as needs-attention, stores linked run ids plus cursor snapshots, reconciles
  terminal linked runs before cursor evaluation, and clears pending fields on
  terminal success/failure.
- Scheduled sync is still foreground `sync` launched by automation. Automation
  passes a stable claim owner, pending timeout, and failed-attempt budget.
  `SyncLedgerEntry.failed_attempts` stops repeated failures at
  `sync-retry-budget-exhausted`.
- Run records now have an explicit lifecycle transition: queued at creation,
  running before Ingest/Garden side effects, then terminal done/failed/cancelled.
- Run cancellation is durable and idempotent. Terminal runs are not rewritten by
  `jobs cancel`; queued/running runs get a final `cancelled` status event; and
  later terminal `finish(...)` calls return the cancelled record unchanged.
- Ingest remains source-kind agnostic. It resolves `SourceBrief` values, asks
  `SourcesService.inspect_runtime(...)` for snapshots, renders typed runtime
  JSON into the prompt, calls the selected harness, validates wiki-root
  mutation safety, refreshes the index, and records the run. Normalized
  harness events are recorded before safety/success validation.
- The CLI remains a thin adapter. Do not shell out to `codealmanac` from
  workflows, automation, tests, or future server wrappers.

## Recent Slices

Slice 28 added `FilesystemSourceRuntimeAdapter` under
`integrations/sources/filesystem/`.

Behavior:

- supports `path.file`, `path.directory`, and `path.unknown`
- reads explicit text files with bounded bytes
- decodes file bytes through `charset-normalizer`
- returns unavailable runtime for missing or binary files
- walks directories lazily and stops after a file-count bound
- applies root `.gitignore` patterns through `pathspec`
- skips generated/private traversal paths such as `.git/`, `.almanac/`,
  `node_modules/`, virtualenv/cache directories, `.gitignore`, and `.env`
  files
- renders directory runtime as metadata, a compact tree, and included file
  sections
- makes ordinary `note.md` ingest prompt content available instead of skipped

Runtime dependencies added:

- `pathspec>=1.1.1`
- `charset-normalizer>=3.4.7`

Slice 29 added the manual `codealmanac update` command.

Behavior:

- detects install metadata through `importlib.metadata`
- supports uv tool installs with `uv tool upgrade codealmanac`
- supports pip installs with `python -m pip install --upgrade codealmanac`
- refuses editable/source installs with `run: git pull && uv sync`
- keeps update automation unscheduled until non-editable install dogfood exists

Slice 48 dogfooded non-editable update installs.

Behavior:

- pip-installed wheel metadata reports `installer: pip`
- pip update plans the throwaway venv Python command
- uv-tool-installed wheel metadata reports `installer: uv`
- uv-tool update plans `uv tool upgrade codealmanac`
- successful foreground package-manager execution returns status `completed`
  instead of over-claiming installed files changed
- scheduled update automation remains deferred until notifier cadence,
  dismissal behavior, and release-channel policy are agreed

Slice 30 added the viewer file route.

Behavior:

- `ViewerService.file(...)` uses the index mentions query to find pages that
  reference a file or folder
- `/api/file?path=src/foo.py` returns `ViewerFile` payloads
- frontend file refs in the right rail route to `#/file/<path>`
- parent traversal such as `../secret.txt` is rejected before querying
- the route is graph navigation, not source-code preview

Slice 31 added Git-backed filesystem directory listing.

Behavior:

- directory runtime runs `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard`
  when the selected directory is inside a Git worktree
- nested `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and global Git excludes are handled
  by Git rather than copied into Python
- CodeAlmanac still filters private/generated defaults such as `.almanac/`,
  `.env`, and `.gitignore`
- non-Git directories keep the old bounded Python/pathspec walk
- runtime metadata includes `listing_source: git` or `listing_source: walk`

Slice 32 adds changed-first directory selection.

Behavior:

- Git-listed directory runtime also asks `git status --porcelain=v1 -z` for the
  selected path
- changed and untracked files are ranked before unchanged files
- unchanged files keep deterministic content/path ordering
- runtime metadata includes `selection_policy: changed_first`
- the rendered tree annotates included files as `changed` or `unchanged`

Slice 33 adds public contract guards.

Behavior:

- `tests/test_public_contract.py` asserts the only project script is
  `codealmanac`
- parser tests reject hosted or alias commands such as `login`, `connect`,
  `upload`, `capture`, `absorb`, `use`, `sources`, `mcp`, and `sdk`
- package tree tests reject `sdk` and `mcp` Python modules

Slice 34 adds the local manual surface.

Behavior:

- `src/codealmanac/manual/` packages the wiki-maintenance rulebook
- `ManualLibrary` reads bundled docs, installs missing workspace manual files,
  and reports workspace completeness
- `app.py` wires `ManualLibrary` once and injects it into `WikiService` and
  `DiagnosticsService`
- `codealmanac init` and `codealmanac build` copy missing files into
  `<almanac-root>/manual/` without overwriting local edits
- `codealmanac doctor` reports `install.manual` and `wiki.manual`
- lifecycle prompts point agents at the configured root's `manual/` before wiki
  edits

Slice 35 adds sync pending claims.

Behavior:

- foreground `sync` writes a `PENDING` sync ledger entry before invoking Ingest
- pending entries record owner, start time, and claimed line range
- ledger keys use normalized transcript paths, and lookup can match stored
  entries by normalized app/session/transcript identity
- active pending entries are skipped by status/run
- stale pending entries surface as needs-attention instead of being skipped
  forever
- terminal success/failure clears pending fields
- this is not a full background retry/reconciliation loop

Slice 36 adds run lifecycle state.

Behavior:

- `RunsService.mark_running(...)` moves a queued run to running
- `RunStore` sets `started_at` and appends a `running` status event
- marking an already running run is idempotent
- marking a terminal run running raises a conflict
- Ingest and Garden mark their run records running before side-effecting work
- this prepares sync reconciliation but does not add a background queue or
  pending run id yet

Slice 37 adds sync pending run linkage.

Behavior:

- `IngestWorkflow.run(...)` keeps its public contract but now delegates to
  `start(...)` and `run_with_run(...)`
- foreground `sync` creates the Ingest run before claiming the transcript range
- pending sync ledger entries store `pending_run_id`, `pending_to_size`,
  `pending_prefix_hash`, and claimed line range
- `sync status` reports linked active runs as `sync-pending-run-active`
- `sync status` reports linked terminal done runs as `sync-pending-run-done`
- foreground `sync` promotes linked done pending cursors before checking for
  newer transcript bytes
- foreground `sync` clears failed/cancelled linked pending claims and retries
  from the last successful cursor when the transcript prefix still matches
- unlinked pending entries keep the existing active/stale timeout behavior

Slice 46 ports the serve visual system.

Behavior:

- local viewer uses UseAlmanac-inspired dashboard shell, left rail, account
  picker styling, search header, page list rows, wiki page surface, and side
  panel styling
- product IA stays local: overview, page, topic, search, and file-reference
  routes over repo-owned wiki pages
- no hosted account, billing, settings, or UseAlmanac hosted wiki routes
- do not copy the current UseAlmanac wiki page/search UX; preserve the
  sidebar-first local reader shape and improve the design layer around it
- browser-harness verified desktop page/search/file/wikilink navigation and
  mobile no-overflow behavior

Slice 47 modularizes the serve frontend.

Behavior:

- `app.js` is a tiny ES module entrypoint
- `server/assets/viewer/api.js` owns viewer HTTP calls
- `server/assets/viewer/routes.js` owns hash parsing and href builders
- `server/assets/viewer/components.js` owns shared DOM pieces
- `server/assets/viewer/renderers.js` owns page/search/topic/file screens
- `server/assets/viewer/main.js` wires browser events and state
- `/assets/{path}` validates and serves nested package assets
- React/Next.js remains deferred until real viewer complexity requires it

Slice 38 adds the database boundary.

Behavior:

- `src/codealmanac/database/` now exposes `connect_sqlite(...)`,
  `apply_migrations(...)`, and `SQLiteMigration`
- SQLite parent directory creation, row factory setup, `foreign_keys`, and
  `journal_mode=WAL` live in `database/`
- `services/index/store.py` supplies a typed rebuild migration for `index.db`
- `IndexStore` still owns the schema DDL, refresh/rebuild behavior, search SQL,
  topic SQL, health SQL, and row conversion
- `tests/test_architecture.py` rejects direct `sqlite3` imports outside the
  database package

Slice 39 adds the config boundary.

Behavior:

- `src/codealmanac/services/config/` now exposes Pydantic config models,
  `LoadConfigRequest`, `ConfigStore`, and `ConfigService`
- `ConfigStore` reads TOML through `pydantic-settings`
  `TomlConfigSettingsSource`
- `ConfigService` merges defaults, user config, and selected-project config
- `ingest`, `garden`, `sync`, `sync status`, and `automation install` resolve
  lifecycle defaults through `app.config`
- `tests/test_architecture.py` rejects `tomllib` imports outside
  `services/config`

Slice 40 splits the CLI edge.

Behavior:

- `src/codealmanac/cli/main.py` owns parser invocation, app construction,
  dispatch, and known error formatting only
- parser construction lives under `cli/parser/` by command domain
- dispatch and render live under `cli/dispatch/root.py` and
  `cli/render/root.py`
- architecture tests keep `main.py` and parser root thin

Slice 41 adds configurable Almanac roots.

Behavior:

- first-time `codealmanac init` and `codealmanac build` default to
  `--root almanac`
- existing registered repos keep their registered root when `--root` is omitted
- setup can explicitly use `--root docs/almanac`
- `WorkspaceRegistryEntry` stores `almanac_root`
- `WorkspacesService.resolve(...)` discovers default roots plus roots already
  present in the registry
- `codealmanac list` prints name, repo path, and configured root
- `WikiService`, index, runs, sync ledger, config, prompts, and manual surfaces
  resolve through `workspace.almanac_path`
- transcript candidates now carry `almanac_path`
- index health receives the true repo root rather than assuming
  `almanac_path.parent`

Slice 42 adds source runtime context.

Behavior:

- `SourceRuntimeContext` carries repo-relative ignored directories into source
  runtime inspection
- Ingest sets that context from `workspace.almanac_root`
- filesystem directory runtime applies the ignored directories in both Git and
  non-Git traversal
- filesystem runtime no longer treats `almanac/` or `docs/almanac/` as
  universal ignore names

Slice 43 adds scheduled sync retry policy.

Behavior:

- automation installs scheduled sync with `--claim-owner
  codealmanac.automation.sync`, `--pending-timeout 24h`, and
  `--max-failed-attempts 3`
- sync ledger entries record `failed_attempts`
- failed Ingest attempts increment the counter
- successful absorb resets the counter
- exhausted failed entries report `sync-retry-budget-exhausted` instead of
  retrying forever

Slice 44 adds clean directory diversity.

Behavior:

- filesystem runtime selection is a pure adapter-local ranking core after
  Git/walk I/O has produced candidates
- changed and untracked files still rank before unchanged files
- unchanged file selection interleaves directory groups before taking a second
  file from the same group
- role-bearing files such as `service.py`, `adapter.py`, `app.py`, and
  `main.py` rank ahead of generic source files inside a group
- Git directory metadata now reports `selection_policy: changed_then_diverse`

Slice 45 locks viewer wikilink token safety.

Behavior:

- `MarkdownRenderer` parses CommonMark with `markdown-it-py`
- wikilink rewriting only rewrites inline child tokens with type `text`
- inline code and fenced code containing `[[...]]` remain code text
- wikilink labels render through text tokens, so HTML in labels is escaped
- server and viewer service layers do not perform raw HTML string rewrites

## Next Move

1. Likely next pressure points:
   - one more lifecycle dogfood for prompt quality and real project behavior; add
     source-runtime ranking/recency only after a failing case proves current
     diversity is insufficient
   - scheduled update automation only after non-editable update dogfood
   - serve polish after product review; slice 51 browser-verified the sidebar
     shell through an isolated temporary Chrome profile, while default-profile
     Chrome remote debugging still needs the manual Allow click
   - manual replacement policy only if users need a workflow for accepting
     bundled doctrine changes; doctor now reports drift, while build/init still
     copy missing files only
   - index refresh cost only after large-repo dogfood proves source-signature
     parsing is too slow; slice 50 split read views but did not optimize refresh
   - richer registry filtering only if local wiki management needs more than
     explicit JSON/drop/drop-missing
2. Do not add hosted CLI, login/connect/upload, cloud capture/upload, MCP, SDK,
   public `capture`, public `absorb`, or public `almanac`/`alm` aliases.
3. Keep future source material additions inside `SourceAddress -> SourceRef ->
   SourceBrief -> SourceRuntime` unless the live agreement changes.
4. Browser-harness note from 2026-06-29: Chrome remote debugging is available
   in this workspace. Slice 46 verified `serve` with browser-harness on
   desktop and mobile. Keep using browser-harness for future visual changes.

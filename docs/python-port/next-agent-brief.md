# Next Agent Brief

Updated: 2026-06-29

## Current State

- Goal is active: rebuild CodeAlmanac from scratch as a Python codebase.
- Branch: `codex/python-port-archive-existing-code`.
- Archive/docs baseline committed as `4520812`.
- First Python scaffold committed as `a803f63`.
- `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md` is the live contract.
- `docs/reference/cosmic-python/` contains Markdown-only reference chapters.
- Steering docs live in `docs/python-port/`.
- Python code exists under `src/codealmanac/` with CLI, app composition,
  workspaces, wiki scaffold/build workflow, SQLite FTS5 read model, search,
  show, topics, health, tag/untag, topic mutation, build, reindex, doctor, and
  the first local `serve` viewer.
- `services/runs` owns the local run ledger under `.almanac/jobs/`; public
  inspection stays under `codealmanac jobs`.
- `services/sources` owns source input contracts: raw addresses, parsed refs,
  source briefs, local path observations, file fingerprints, transcript
  discovery ports, typed transcript candidates, source runtime snapshots, and
  Pydantic URL validation. Git, GitHub, and transcript runtime adapters are
  wired by default.
- `services/harnesses` owns normalized Codex/Claude task, readiness, and result
  contracts plus provider transcript refs and the adapter port. Claude CLI and
  Codex CLI are both concrete adapters wired by default.
- `workflows/ingest` now coordinates source resolution, harness execution, run
  ledger updates, `.almanac/` mutation safety, and index refresh.
- `workflows/garden` now coordinates whole-wiki maintenance from index and
  health context, harness execution, run ledger updates, `.almanac/` mutation
  safety, and index refresh.
- `workflows/sync` currently supports read-only status. It discovers local
  Codex and Claude transcripts through `SourcesService`, applies quiet-window
  and cursor checks, skips recorded internal lifecycle transcripts, runs
  foreground Ingest for ready transcripts, commits successful cursors to
  `.almanac/jobs/sync-ledger.json`, and reports readiness without duplicating
  wiki-writing logic.
- Ingest and Garden now attach optional `HarnessTranscriptRef` values to run
  records as soon as a harness returns. Claude uses its structured
  `session_id`; Codex uses best-effort local transcript lookup.
- `src/codealmanac/prompts/` contains packaged Markdown prompt doctrine and
  operation prompts. `PromptRenderer` composes those resources with typed
  runtime JSON for Ingest and Garden.
- App workflow entrypoints now live under `app.workflows.build`,
  `app.workflows.ingest`, `app.workflows.garden`, and
  `app.workflows.sync`. `create_app()` wires the default Claude and Codex
  harness adapters plus transcript discovery and source runtime adapters.
- Lifecycle writes now require Git change tracking, clean `.almanac/`
  preflight, and no non-wiki mutation during harness execution. Dirty app files
  are allowed as source material if they remain unchanged.
- The index read model now uses stale-aware source signatures for ordinary
  `ensure_fresh`; `reindex` remains the explicit forced rebuild command.
- Current implemented CLI commands are `init`, `build`, `list`, `search`,
  `show`, `topics`, `health`, `reindex`, `doctor`, `jobs`, `serve`, `tag`,
  `untag`, `ingest`, `garden`, `sync`, `sync status`, and
  `automation install|status|uninstall`.
- Public `codealmanac ingest` is a thin CLI adapter over
  `app.workflows.ingest.run(...)`. It supports `--using claude|codex`, `--wiki`,
  `--title`, and `--guidance`.
- Public `codealmanac garden` is a thin CLI adapter over
  `app.workflows.garden.run(...)`. It supports `--using claude|codex`, `--wiki`,
  `--title`, and `--guidance`.
- Topic metadata mutation now covers `topics create`, `topics describe`,
  `topics link`, `topics unlink`, `topics rename`, and `topics delete`.

## Dirty/Staged Files

Slice 26 is ready to commit if the current worktree still only contains:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `uv.lock`
- `src/codealmanac/integrations/sources/`
- `tests/test_transcript_source_runtime.py`
- `tests/test_sync_workflow.py`
- `docs/python-port/slice-26-transcript-source-runtime.md`
- steering docs under `docs/python-port/`

Before committing slice 26, re-run if any code changes:

- focused transcript runtime, sync workflow, ingest workflow, transcript
  discovery, and architecture tests
- full pytest
- ruff
- `git diff --check`
- a foreground sync dogfood with JSONL transcript runtime material

## Next Move

1. Finish full verification for slice 26, then commit after a final
   `git status` check.
2. Decide whether web URL source runtime, `codealmanac update`, or viewer
   source/file route hardening is the next highest-pressure local product gap.
3. If background sync pending state becomes necessary, add the durable owner
   and reconciliation loop before changing sync cursor semantics.
4. Do not add scheduled update automation before the Python `update` command
   exists.
5. Keep AI execution behind workflow and harness seams; do not put it in CLI.
6. If provider runtime requirements expand to streaming, usage accounting,
   structured output, or subagents, revisit the archived Codex app-server
   adapter as reference instead of stretching the `codex exec` adapter.

## Things Not To Do

- Do not resurrect public `almanac`, `alm`, `absorb`, or `capture` commands.
- Do not make CLI commands the internal API.
- Do not pull hosted product assumptions into local v1.
- Do not copy the TypeScript structure just because it exists in `archive/code/`.

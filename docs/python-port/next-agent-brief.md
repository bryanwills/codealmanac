# Next Agent Brief

Updated: 2026-06-29

## Current State

- Goal is active: rebuild CodeAlmanac from scratch as a Python codebase.
- Branch: `codex/python-port-archive-existing-code`.
- Archive/docs baseline committed as `4520812`.
- First Python scaffold committed as `a803f63`.
- `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md` is the live contract.
- `docs/reference/cosmic-python/` contains Markdown-only reference chapters.
- Steering docs live in `docs/python-port/`.
- Python code exists under `src/codealmanac/` with CLI, app composition,
  workspaces, wiki scaffold/build workflow, SQLite FTS5 read model, search,
  show, topics, health, tag/untag, topic mutation, build, reindex, doctor, and
  the first local `serve` viewer.
- `services/runs` owns the local run ledger under `.almanac/jobs/`; public
  inspection stays under `codealmanac jobs`.
- `services/sources` owns source input contracts: raw addresses, parsed refs,
  source briefs, local path observations, file fingerprints, and Pydantic URL
  validation.
- `services/harnesses` owns normalized Codex/Claude task, readiness, and result
  contracts plus the adapter port. Claude CLI and Codex CLI are both concrete
  adapters wired by default.
- `workflows/ingest` now coordinates source resolution, harness execution, run
  ledger updates, `.almanac/` mutation safety, and index refresh.
- `workflows/garden` now coordinates whole-wiki maintenance from index and
  health context, harness execution, run ledger updates, `.almanac/` mutation
  safety, and index refresh.
- `src/codealmanac/prompts/` contains packaged Markdown prompt doctrine and
  operation prompts. `PromptRenderer` composes those resources with typed
  runtime JSON for Ingest and Garden.
- App workflow entrypoints now live under `app.workflows.build`,
  `app.workflows.ingest`, and `app.workflows.garden`. `create_app()` wires the
  default Claude and Codex adapters.
- Lifecycle writes now require Git change tracking, clean `.almanac/`
  preflight, and no non-wiki mutation during harness execution. Dirty app files
  are allowed as source material if they remain unchanged.
- The index read model now uses stale-aware source signatures for ordinary
  `ensure_fresh`; `reindex` remains the explicit forced rebuild command.
- Current implemented CLI commands are `init`, `build`, `list`, `search`,
  `show`, `topics`, `health`, `reindex`, `doctor`, `jobs`, `serve`, `tag`,
  `untag`, `ingest`, and `garden`.
- Public `codealmanac ingest` is a thin CLI adapter over
  `app.workflows.ingest.run(...)`. It supports `--using claude|codex`, `--wiki`,
  `--title`, and `--guidance`.
- Public `codealmanac garden` is a thin CLI adapter over
  `app.workflows.garden.run(...)`. It supports `--using claude|codex`, `--wiki`,
  `--title`, and `--guidance`.
- Topic metadata mutation now covers `topics create`, `topics describe`,
  `topics link`, `topics unlink`, `topics rename`, and `topics delete`.

    prepared context, clean preflight, `codex succeeded`, and done

## Dirty/Staged Files

After slice 18 is committed, the worktree should be clean. If any slice-18 files
are dirty, re-run focused Garden/prompt/CLI/ingest/architecture tests,
`git diff --check`, pytest, ruff, CLI help, package build inspection, and a real
temp-repo `codealmanac garden --using codex` dogfood run.

## Next Move

1. Add `sync` discovery/automation behind the existing run/safety/harness seams,
   or review prompt quality now that prompt Markdown is packaged.
2. Decide whether the viewer needs source/file route hardening before more
   lifecycle commands.
3. Keep AI execution behind workflow and harness seams; do not put it in CLI.
4. If provider runtime requirements expand to streaming, usage accounting,
   structured output, or subagents, revisit the archived Codex app-server
   adapter as reference instead of stretching the `codex exec` adapter.

## Things Not To Do

- Do not resurrect public `almanac`, `alm`, `absorb`, or `capture` commands.
- Do not make CLI commands the internal API.
- Do not pull hosted product assumptions into local v1.
- Do not copy the TypeScript structure just because it exists in `archive/code/`.

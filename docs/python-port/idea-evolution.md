# Python Port Idea Evolution

Updated: 2026-06-29

Record hypothesis changes here. Do not rewrite history; append a new entry when
evidence changes the shape.

## 2026-06-29 - Fresh Python Codebase, Not a Ported TS Shape

Old hypothesis:
Reuse the existing TypeScript repository shape while translating modules to
Python.

New hypothesis:
Archive the TypeScript implementation under `archive/code/` and rebuild a
Python codebase around service-owned verbs, store-owned persistence,
workflow-owned coordination, and `app.py` as the composition root.

Evidence that forced the change:
The live agreement defines a local-only Python v1 and says the old Node code is
behavior reference, not code to preserve. Cosmic Python's service-layer and
composition-root guidance also pushes entrypoints away from product decisions.

Code or product assumption affected:
CLI commands must dispatch into services/workflows. They must not become the
internal API used by automation or future server wrappers.

Follow-up test:
The first scaffold should include an architecture test that imports the CLI and
application root without importing archived TypeScript paths or constructing
service dependencies in command handlers.

## 2026-06-29 - Viewer Is A Read Service, Not Server-Owned Logic

Old hypothesis:
`serve` could be restored as a server adapter directly over existing read
services, because it is mostly HTTP routing and static assets.

New hypothesis:
`serve` deserves a first-class `viewer` service. The HTTP adapter is only a
primary entrypoint. `ViewerService` owns browser payload assembly over the
existing index service, while markdown truth remains in `wiki` and SQLite
projection truth remains in `index`.

Evidence that forced the change:
The archived `almanac-serve` page shows the viewer has product semantics:
overview, page, topic, search, backlinks, file refs, related pages, and rendered
wikilinks. Cosmic Python chapter 4 says controllers should stay thin once
orchestration starts creeping into the entrypoint.

Code or product assumption affected:
`server/app.py` must not open SQLite, parse pages, or shell out to CLI commands.
Future hosted/server read edges can call the same viewer service if they need
the local viewer contract.

Follow-up test:
Add an architecture test once more server/integration modules exist: server
routes may import app/service request and response models, but must not import
index store modules or wiki document parsers directly.

## 2026-06-29 - Fresh Python Codebase, Not a Ported TS Shape

Old hypothesis:
Reuse the existing TypeScript repository shape while translating modules to
Python.

New hypothesis:
Archive the TypeScript implementation under `archive/code/` and rebuild a
Python codebase around service-owned verbs, store-owned persistence,
workflow-owned coordination, and `app.py` as the composition root.

Evidence that forced the change:
The live agreement defines a local-only Python v1 and says the old Node code is
behavior reference, not code to preserve. Cosmic Python's service-layer and
composition-root guidance also pushes entrypoints away from product decisions.

Code or product assumption affected:
CLI commands must dispatch into services/workflows. They must not become the
internal API used by automation or future server wrappers.

Follow-up test:
The first scaffold should include an architecture test that imports the CLI and
application root without importing archived TypeScript paths or constructing
service dependencies in command handlers.

# Python Port Idea Evolution

Updated: 2026-06-29

Record hypothesis changes here. Do not rewrite history; append a new entry when
evidence changes the shape.

## 2026-06-29 - Fresh Python Codebase, Not a Ported TS Shape

Old hypothesis:
Reuse the existing TypeScript repository shape while translating modules to
Python.

New hypothesis:
Archive the TypeScript implementation under `archive/code/` and rebuild a
Python codebase around service-owned verbs, store-owned persistence,
workflow-owned coordination, and `app.py` as the composition root.

Evidence that forced the change:
The live agreement defines a local-only Python v1 and says the old Node code is
behavior reference, not code to preserve. Cosmic Python's service-layer and
composition-root guidance also pushes entrypoints away from product decisions.

Code or product assumption affected:
CLI commands must dispatch into services/workflows. They must not become the
internal API used by automation or future server wrappers.

Follow-up test:
The first scaffold should include an architecture test that imports the CLI and
application root without importing archived TypeScript paths or constructing
service dependencies in command handlers.

## 2026-06-29 - Viewer Is A Read Service, Not Server-Owned Logic

Old hypothesis:
`serve` could be restored as a server adapter directly over existing read
services, because it is mostly HTTP routing and static assets.

New hypothesis:
`serve` deserves a first-class `viewer` service. The HTTP adapter is only a
primary entrypoint. `ViewerService` owns browser payload assembly over the
existing index service, while markdown truth remains in `wiki` and SQLite
projection truth remains in `index`.

Evidence that forced the change:
The archived `almanac-serve` page shows the viewer has product semantics:
overview, page, topic, search, backlinks, file refs, related pages, and rendered
wikilinks. Cosmic Python chapter 4 says controllers should stay thin once
orchestration starts creeping into the entrypoint.

Code or product assumption affected:
`server/app.py` must not open SQLite, parse pages, or shell out to CLI commands.
Future hosted/server read edges can call the same viewer service if they need
the local viewer contract.

Follow-up test:
Add an architecture test once more server/integration modules exist: server
routes may import app/service request and response models, but must not import
index store modules or wiki document parsers directly.

## 2026-06-29 - Index Freshness Is Not Forced Reindex

Old hypothesis:
Read commands could force a full `.almanac/index.db` rebuild on every
`ensure_fresh` call because the index is a derived local projection and
correctness mattered more than cost during the early read-model slices.

New hypothesis:
`ensure_fresh` should be stale-aware. It may refresh the derived projection
silently, but it should skip SQLite writes when the source wiki signature is
unchanged. `reindex` is the explicit command for a forced projection rebuild.

Evidence that forced the change:
The local `serve` viewer calls several read verbs per browser request. Repeated
overview/search/page traffic made the old force-rebuild behavior a bad default
for long-running local read surfaces. Cosmic Python chapter 12's CQS/CQRS
pressure also separates read adapters from write-side commands.

Code or product assumption affected:
`IndexStore.refresh` owns source-signature comparison and no-op refreshes.
`IndexStore.rebuild` remains the forced path behind `codealmanac reindex`.
`ViewerService` and `server/app.py` must not special-case freshness.

Follow-up test:
Keep the SQLite trigger regression proving unchanged `ensure_fresh` does not
delete/reinsert `pages`, and add a cheaper stat-manifest test only if large-repo
dogfood makes parsing cost visible.

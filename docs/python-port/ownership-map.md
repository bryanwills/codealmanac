# Python Port Ownership Map

Updated: 2026-06-29

This map turns `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md` into implementation
boundaries. If code needs a different boundary, update this file and record the
reason in `idea-evolution.md`.

## Dependency Direction

```text
cli/server
  -> app
    -> workflows
      -> services
        -> stores
        -> ports
          -> integrations
```

`src/codealmanac/app.py` is the composition root. CLI commands, automation
entrypoints, tests, and future server wrappers get an application object from
that root instead of constructing stores or adapters themselves.

## Services

| Service | Owns | First implementation pressure |
|---|---|---|
| `workspaces` | repo root detection, configurable Almanac root, registry, nearest-root discovery, path containment, local wiki selection | `init`, current-repo queries, `--wiki` lookup |
| `wiki` | page files, frontmatter, topics, wikilinks, page writes, health inputs | `init`, `show`, page parsing for index |
| `index` | SQLite read model, FTS, mentions, backlinks, query projections | `search`, `show --links`, `health` |
| `sources` | source observations, source refs, fingerprints, local source state, source runtime snapshots, transcript discovery ports and typed transcript candidates | `SourceAddress`/`SourceRef`/`SourceBrief`/`SourceRuntime`, `SourceRuntimeAdapter`, `TranscriptDiscoveryAdapter`, `TranscriptCandidate`, ingest and sync inputs |
| `runs` | run ledger, events, outputs, lifecycle state transitions, persisted harness transcript identity | `jobs` read surface, lifecycle workflows, future sync exclusion and reconciliation |
| `harnesses` | normalized Codex/Claude run contracts, provider transcript refs, and ports | `HarnessKind`/`RunHarnessRequest`/`HarnessRunResult`/`HarnessTranscriptRef`/`HarnessAdapter`, later `build`, `ingest`, `garden` |
| `automation` | local scheduler decisions, quiet windows, installed task state | `AutomationTask`/`ScheduledJob`/`SchedulerAdapter`, `sync` and `garden` scheduling |
| `config` | user/project TOML parsing and precedence for local CLI defaults | lifecycle harness default and sync quiet window |
| `diagnostics` | doctor checks and readiness reports | `doctor`, local install/wiki readiness |
| `updates` | package update planning, installer metadata, supported foreground update methods | `codealmanac update`, `PackageInstallMetadataProvider`, `PackageCommandRunner` |
| `viewer` | read-only browser payloads, page/topic/search/file overview assembly, rendered markdown for the local viewer | `serve`, future non-CLI read adapter |

## Support Packages

| Package | Owns | First implementation pressure |
|---|---|---|
| `database` | SQLite connection setup, PRAGMA policy, and migration application helpers | `index.db` read model |
| `prompts` | packaged lifecycle prompt doctrine and operation prompt rendering | `ingest`, `garden`, future `sync` |
| `manual` | packaged wiki-maintenance rulebook and workspace manual materialization helpers | `build`, `doctor`, lifecycle prompt guidance |

## Workflows

| Workflow | Owns | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | initial wiki creation or refresh | `workspaces`, `wiki`, `index` |
| `ingest` | update wiki from selected local material | `sources`, `runs`, `harnesses`, `index`, `prompts`, `lifecycle` |
| `sync` | discover quiet local transcripts, skip internal lifecycle transcripts, evaluate cursor readiness, claim pending transcript ranges with run linkage, reconcile terminal pending runs, run foreground ingest, clear terminal claims, and update sync cursor ledger | `sources`, `runs`, `ingest`, sync ledger, later `automation` |
| `garden` | maintain wiki shape, links, topics, staleness, quality | `health`, `index`, `runs`, `harnesses`, `prompts`, `lifecycle` |

Workflows coordinate. They do not own durable schema unless a missing service is
identified and added to this map.

`workflows/lifecycle.py` owns shared lifecycle execution helpers: harness-result
validation and Git-backed wiki-root mutation safety. Operation-specific
workflows pass their public verb into `LifecycleMutationPolicy`, so shared
safety does not leak another workflow's product language.

## Integration Rule

Concrete adapters live under `integrations/` by the service port they implement:

```text
integrations/
  harnesses/
    codex/
    claude/
  sources/
    filesystem/
    git/
    github/
    transcripts/
    web/
  automation/
    scheduler/
  updates/
```

An integration translates outside-world behavior into service-owned models and
errors. It does not decide product policy.

`src/codealmanac/app.py` is the only production module that wires concrete
integrations. Tests enforce that `cli/`, `workflows/`, and `services/` do not
import `codealmanac.integrations`.

`services/workspaces/ports.py` also owns `WorkspaceChangeProbe`, the port used
by lifecycle workflows to inspect repo/worktree mutation state. The concrete
Git implementation lives in `integrations/workspaces/git/`. Ingest policy
decides what mutations are allowed; the Git integration only reports observed
state.

`integrations/command.py` holds captured subprocess execution shared by local
integration adapters. It is not a service port because it describes local
process mechanics, not a product contract.

`database/` holds local SQLite mechanics shared by stores. `connect_sqlite`
creates parent directories, applies row factory and PRAGMA policy, and returns
the connection. `apply_migrations` applies typed `SQLiteMigration` values in
version order. Product stores still own SQL schema text, row conversion, and
query semantics.

`services/config/` owns local config parsing and precedence. `ConfigStore`
uses `pydantic-settings` TOML sources to build the frozen
`CodeAlmanacConfig` settings model. `ConfigService` supplies sources in
precedence order: selected project `<almanac-root>/config.toml`, then user
config, then model defaults. CLI flags remain the final override at the
command edge. There is no public `config` command in v1.

`services/workspaces/roots.py` owns repo-local Almanac root validation and
nearest-root discovery. `DEFAULT_ALMANAC_ROOT` is `almanac/`. The registry
stores each workspace's repo-relative `almanac_root`; downstream services use
`workspace.almanac_path` instead of concatenating a literal path.

`integrations/harnesses/git_status.py` holds Git porcelain changed-file
snapshots shared by Claude and Codex harness adapters.

`services/sources/ports.py` owns `TranscriptDiscoveryAdapter`, the port used by
sync to observe local transcript stores. Concrete Codex and Claude JSONL
scanners live in `integrations/sources/transcripts/`. Those integrations parse
raw provider JSON and return typed `TranscriptCandidate` values; they do not
decide quiet windows, cursor state, or whether ingest should run.
`TranscriptCandidate` carries both `repo_root` and `almanac_path` so sync can
write ledgers under the configured root without guessing.

`workflows/sync` owns sync ledger cursor policy. It writes a durable pending
claim with the selected run id before calling Ingest, treats active linked runs
as skipped work, reports terminal linked runs as needs-reconcile during
read-only status, reconciles terminal linked runs during foreground sync, and
clears pending fields on success or failure. This is still foreground sync
ownership; a future background worker may add queue ownership and retry policy
without changing transcript discovery adapters.

The same source service owns `SourceRuntimeAdapter`, the port used by Ingest to
turn selected source refs into bounded readable material before harness
execution. `integrations/sources/filesystem/` reads explicit local files and
bounded directory material, using Git-backed directory listing inside worktrees,
Git porcelain status for changed-first directory selection, `pathspec` as the
non-Git fallback, and `charset-normalizer` for text decoding.
`integrations/sources/git/` uses Git CLI commands for local
`git:diff` and `git:range` refs. `integrations/sources/github/` uses GitHub CLI
for PR and issue refs. `integrations/sources/transcripts/` reads provider JSONL
transcripts with `jsonlines`, validates known Codex and Claude shapes with
Pydantic, and renders bounded transcript snapshots. Ingest does not branch on
source kind. `integrations/sources/web/` uses `httpx` plus Beautiful Soup to
fetch generic web URLs, remove non-readable HTML nodes, and render bounded
HTML/text snapshots through the same source-runtime port.

`services/automation/ports.py` owns `SchedulerAdapter`, the port used by local
automation install/status/uninstall. The launchd implementation lives in
`integrations/automation/scheduler/` and only translates `ScheduledJob` models
into plist files plus launchctl calls. It does not decide which jobs should
exist or what `sync` and `garden` mean.

`services/updates/ports.py` owns package install metadata and package command
execution ports. `integrations/updates/` reads `importlib.metadata` install
metadata and runs foreground package-manager commands. The service decides
whether an install is safe to update; the integration only reports metadata and
executes the chosen command.

`services/viewer` owns the local browser payload for file references. Its
`file` verb delegates to the index's mentions query and returns matching wiki
pages. It must not read repo source contents directly or reuse source runtime
adapters; selected source material belongs to lifecycle workflows, while viewer
file routes are graph-navigation routes.

`manual/` is a support package rather than a product service. `ManualLibrary`
loads bundled Markdown resources, installs missing files into
`<almanac-root>/manual/`, and reports workspace manual completeness. `app.py`
constructs it once and injects it into `WikiService` and `DiagnosticsService`.
There is no public `manual` command in v1.

## First Slice Boundary

The first Python implementation slice should prove:

- package install metadata exists
- `codealmanac` invokes a Python CLI
- `app.py` wires a minimal application object
- `workspaces` can resolve and initialize a local configurable Almanac root
- tests run through public service/CLI entrypoints, not hidden helpers

This is intentionally smaller than the full product surface. It should create
the spine that future slices extend without rework.

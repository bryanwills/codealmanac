# Python Port Ownership Map

Updated: 2026-07-01

This map turns `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md` into implementation
boundaries. If code needs a different boundary, update this file and record the
reason in `idea-evolution.md`.

## Dependency Direction

```text
cli/server
  -> app
    -> workflows
      -> services
        -> stores
        -> ports
          -> integrations
```

`src/codealmanac/app.py` is the composition root. CLI commands, automation
entrypoints, tests, and future server wrappers get an application object from
that root instead of constructing stores or adapters themselves.

## Services

| Service | Owns | First implementation pressure |
|---|---|---|
| `workspaces` | repo root detection, configurable Almanac root, registry, nearest-root discovery, path containment, local wiki selection, explicit registry cleanup | `init`, `list`, current-repo queries, `--wiki` lookup |
| `wiki` | page files, frontmatter, topics, wikilinks, page writes, health inputs | `init`, `show`, page parsing for index |
| `index` | SQLite derived read model, projection refresh/write facade, read-only query views, FTS, mentions, backlinks, health projections | `search`, `show --links`, `health` |
| `sources` | source observations, source refs, fingerprints, local source state, source runtime snapshots, transcript discovery ports and typed transcript candidates | `SourceAddress`/`SourceRef`/`SourceBrief`/`SourceRuntime`, `SourceRuntimeAdapter`, `TranscriptDiscoveryAdapter`, `TranscriptCandidate`, ingest and sync inputs |
| `runs` | run ledger, events, outputs, lifecycle state transitions, persisted harness transcript identity | `jobs` read surface, lifecycle workflows, future sync exclusion and reconciliation |
| `harnesses` | normalized Codex/Claude run contracts, provider transcript refs, provider-neutral harness events, and ports | `HarnessKind`/`RunHarnessRequest`/`HarnessRunResult`/`HarnessTranscriptRef`/`HarnessEvent`/`HarnessAdapter`, later `build`, `ingest`, `garden` |
| `automation` | local scheduler decisions, quiet windows, unattended sync command policy, installed task state | `AutomationTask`/`ScheduledJob`/`SchedulerAdapter`, `sync` and `garden` scheduling |
| `config` | user/project TOML parsing and precedence for local CLI defaults | lifecycle harness default and sync quiet window |
| `diagnostics` | doctor checks and readiness reports | `doctor`, local install/wiki readiness |
| `updates` | package update planning, installer metadata, supported foreground update methods | `codealmanac update`, `PackageInstallMetadataProvider`, `PackageCommandRunner` |
| `setup` | setup/uninstall command requests, setup-owned agent instruction result models, and the instruction installer port | `codealmanac setup`, `codealmanac uninstall` |
| `viewer` | read-only browser payloads, page/topic/search/file overview assembly, multi-wiki local viewer scope, rendered markdown for the local viewer | `serve`, future non-CLI read adapter |

## Support Packages

| Package | Owns | First implementation pressure |
|---|---|---|
| `database` | SQLite connection setup, PRAGMA policy, and migration application helpers | `index.db` read model |
| `prompts` | packaged lifecycle prompt doctrine and operation prompt rendering | `ingest`, `garden`, future `sync` |
| `manual` | packaged wiki-maintenance rulebook and workspace manual materialization helpers | `build`, `doctor`, lifecycle prompt guidance |

## Workflows

| Workflow | Owns | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | initial wiki creation or refresh | `workspaces`, `wiki`, `index` |
| `ingest` | update wiki from selected local material | `sources`, `runs`, `harnesses`, `index`, `prompts`, `lifecycle` |
| `sync` | discover quiet local transcripts, scope them to local wikis, coordinate run-record lookup and ledger persistence, call sync policy for cursor/ledger decisions, run foreground ingest or enqueue background ingest, and assemble sync summaries | `sources`, `runs`, `ingest`, `run_queue`, sync ledger store, sync policy, automation command policy |
| `garden` | maintain wiki shape, links, topics, staleness, quality | `health`, `index`, `runs`, `harnesses`, `prompts`, `lifecycle` |

Workflows coordinate. They do not own durable schema unless a missing service is
identified and added to this map.

`workflows/lifecycle.py` owns shared lifecycle execution helpers: harness-result
validation and Git-backed wiki-root mutation safety. Operation-specific
workflows pass their public verb into `LifecycleMutationPolicy`, so shared
safety does not leak another workflow's product language.

## Integration Rule

Concrete adapters live under `integrations/` by the service port they implement:

```text
integrations/
  harnesses/
    codex/
    claude/
  sources/
    filesystem/
    git/
    github/
    transcripts/
    web/
  automation/
    scheduler/
  setup/
  updates/
```

An integration translates outside-world behavior into service-owned models and
errors. It does not decide product policy.

`src/codealmanac/app.py` is the only production module that wires concrete
integrations. Tests enforce that `cli/`, `workflows/`, and `services/` do not
import `codealmanac.integrations`.

`services/workspaces/ports.py` also owns `WorkspaceChangeProbe`, the port used
by lifecycle workflows to inspect repo/worktree mutation state. The concrete
Git implementation lives in `integrations/workspaces/git/`. Ingest policy
decides what mutations are allowed; the Git integration only reports observed
state.

`integrations/command.py` holds captured subprocess execution shared by local
integration adapters. It is not a service port because it describes local
process mechanics, not a product contract.

`database/` holds local SQLite mechanics shared by stores. `connect_sqlite`
creates parent directories, applies row factory and PRAGMA policy, sets a
busy timeout before WAL mode, and returns the connection. `apply_migrations`
applies typed `SQLiteMigration` values in version order. Product stores still
own SQL schema text and write/query semantics.

`services/index/store.py` owns the derived `index.db` schema, migrations,
source loading, and projection writes. `services/index/views.py` is a small
read facade. `services/index/search_views.py` owns FTS and file-mention query
construction, `summary_views.py` owns count summaries, `page_views.py` owns
page detail projections, `topic_views.py` owns topic DAG reads, and
`health_views.py` owns health findings.

`services/config/` owns local config parsing and precedence. `ConfigStore`
uses `pydantic-settings` TOML sources to build the frozen
`CodeAlmanacConfig` settings model. `ConfigService` supplies sources in
precedence order: selected project `<almanac-root>/config.toml`, then user
config, then model defaults. CLI flags remain the final override at the
command edge. There is no public `config` command in v1.

`services/workspaces/roots.py` owns repo-local Almanac root validation and
nearest-root discovery. `DEFAULT_ALMANAC_ROOT` is `almanac/`. The registry
stores each workspace's repo-relative `almanac_root`; downstream services use
`workspace.almanac_path` instead of concatenating a literal path.

`integrations/harnesses/git_status.py` holds Git porcelain changed-file
snapshots shared by Claude and Codex harness adapters.

Harness adapters translate provider output into `HarnessEvent` values before
workflows persist anything to run logs. Raw provider transcript files are not a
workflow contract; they are optional provider evidence for exclusion and
debugging.

`services/runs/store.py` is the service-facing repository facade for the run
ledger. `services/runs/paths.py` owns run-id validation and file naming,
`services/runs/io.py` owns JSON record/spec and JSONL event file mechanics,
`services/runs/locks.py` owns worker lock ownership, and
`services/runs/transitions.py` owns grouped record-plus-event transition writes.
Callers should not hand-pair record rewrites with status event appends outside
the transition writer.

`services/sources/ports.py` owns `TranscriptDiscoveryAdapter`, the port used by
sync to observe local transcript stores. Concrete Codex and Claude JSONL
scanners live in `integrations/sources/transcripts/`. Those integrations parse
raw provider JSON and return typed `TranscriptCandidate` values; they do not
decide quiet windows, cursor state, or whether ingest should run.
`TranscriptCandidate` carries both `repo_root` and `almanac_path` so sync can
write ledgers under the configured root without guessing.

`workflows/sync/service.py` owns sync orchestration. It discovers transcripts,
scopes them to the requested local wiki, loads run records and ledgers, starts
foreground ingest or queues background ingest, spawns local workers, persists
ledger changes, and assembles summaries.

`workflows/sync/policy.py` owns deterministic sync ledger cursor and retry
policy. It builds ledger keys, finds matching ledger entries, reads transcript
snapshots, hashes cursor prefixes, writes pending/absorbed/failed entry
transitions, reconciles terminal linked runs, treats active linked runs as
skipped work, reports terminal linked runs as needs-reconcile during read-only
status, increments failed attempts when transcript ingest fails, stops retrying
when the failed-attempt budget is exhausted, and generates cursor guidance for
Ingest. Scheduled sync uses the same workflow/policy split.

The same source service owns `SourceRuntimeAdapter`, the port used by Ingest to
turn selected source refs into bounded readable material before harness
execution. `integrations/sources/filesystem/` reads explicit local files and
bounded directory material. `adapter.py` implements the service-owned
`SourceRuntimeAdapter` port and delegates to module-level responsibilities:
`documents.py` owns text document models, file byte bounds, and
`charset-normalizer` decoding; `listing.py` owns ignore specs, Git-backed
directory listing inside worktrees, Git porcelain status for changed-first
directory selection, Python walking through `pathspec`, and directory document
assembly; `selection.py` owns semantic diversity for clean directory
selection; `rendering.py` owns prompt-facing runtime text; `paths.py` owns
shared display/relative path helpers. The adapter normalizes the request `cwd`
before delegating because source refs are already normalized; this keeps
symlinked and macOS alias paths rendered relative to the selected workspace.
`InspectSourceRuntimeRequest.context.ignored_directories` carries workflow-owned
runtime policy such as the resolved `workspace.almanac_root`; filesystem
adapters apply those ignores but do not hard-code Almanac root names.
`integrations/sources/git/` uses Git CLI commands for local
`git:diff` and `git:range` refs. `integrations/sources/github/` uses GitHub CLI
for PR and issue refs. `integrations/sources/transcripts/` reads provider JSONL
transcripts with `jsonlines`, validates known Codex and Claude shapes with
Pydantic, and renders bounded transcript snapshots. Ingest does not branch on
source kind. `integrations/sources/web/` uses `httpx` plus Beautiful Soup to
fetch generic web URLs, remove non-readable HTML nodes, and render bounded
HTML/text snapshots through the same source-runtime port.

`services/automation/ports.py` owns `SchedulerAdapter`, the port used by local
automation install/status/uninstall. The automation service decides scheduled
task command policy, including sync's stable claim owner, pending timeout, and
failed-attempt budget. The launchd implementation lives in
`integrations/automation/scheduler/` and only translates `ScheduledJob` models
into plist files plus launchctl calls. It does not decide which jobs should
exist or what `sync` and `garden` mean.

`services/updates/ports.py` owns package install metadata and package command
execution ports. `integrations/updates/` reads `importlib.metadata` install
metadata and runs foreground package-manager commands. The service decides
whether an install is safe to update; the integration only reports metadata and
executes the chosen command.

`services/setup/ports.py` owns `InstructionInstaller`, the port used by setup
and uninstall for global agent instruction artifacts. `integrations/setup/`
translates that port into filesystem edits for Codex and Claude: a managed
`codealmanac` AGENTS block for Codex, and a `~/.claude/codealmanac.md` guide
plus `CLAUDE.md` import for Claude. The adapter removes only current
setup-owned `codealmanac` artifacts; old `almanac` artifacts are outside
Python v1 compatibility scope.

`services/viewer` owns the local browser payload for file references. Its
`file` verb delegates to the index's mentions query and returns matching wiki
pages. It must not read repo source contents directly or reuse source runtime
adapters; selected source material belongs to lifecycle workflows, while viewer
file routes are graph-navigation routes. `services/viewer/renderer.py` owns
Markdown rendering and token-level wikilink rewriting for the local viewer; it
rewrites text inline tokens and leaves code tokens untouched.
`services/viewer` also owns local wiki scope for the viewer. Overview responses
return the selected workspace plus available registered local workspaces, using
`workspace_id` as the stable selector. The service skips unavailable registry
entries without dropping them. The server and browser pass optional wiki
selectors; they do not decide registry availability or workspace fallback.

`server/assets/` owns the packaged browser shell for `serve`. It can borrow
UseAlmanac's visual language, but it must preserve `services/viewer` as the
product contract and keep local wiki navigation first: sidebar, overview,
page, topic, search, file-reference graph routes, and read-only page viewing.
Hosted UseAlmanac account, billing, settings, and hosted wiki-search flows do
not belong in this local viewer.

`cli/render/setup.py` owns Rich-backed setup/uninstall terminal presentation.
It renders service-returned facts only. Rich must not be imported from services,
workflows, integrations, or stores.

The browser shell stays static package data while it is small. `app.js` is the
module entrypoint. `server/assets/viewer/api.js` owns HTTP calls, `routes.js`
owns hash parsing and href construction, `components.js` owns shared DOM
pieces, `renderers.js` owns screen assembly, and `main.js` wires browser events
and the selected wiki switcher to those modules. Sidebar page/topic active
state is browser route state over the existing hash routes, not a second server
contract. The server owns validation and delivery of nested package assets
through `/assets/{path}`.

`manual/` is a support package rather than a product service. `ManualLibrary`
loads bundled Markdown resources, installs missing files into
`<almanac-root>/manual/`, and reports workspace manual completeness plus exact
differences from bundled docs. `app.py` constructs it once and injects it into
`WikiService` and `DiagnosticsService`. There is no public `manual` command in
v1. Manual drift is diagnostic: `doctor` can ask the user to review changed
files, but build/init do not overwrite local manual edits.

## First Slice Boundary

The first Python implementation slice should prove:

- package install metadata exists
- `codealmanac` invokes a Python CLI
- `app.py` wires a minimal application object
- `workspaces` can resolve and initialize a local configurable Almanac root
- tests run through public service/CLI entrypoints, not hidden helpers

This is intentionally smaller than the full product surface. It should create
the spine that future slices extend without rework.

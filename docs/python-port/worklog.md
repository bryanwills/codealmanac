# Python Port Worklog

## 2026-06-29

- Active goal created for a full Python rewrite using
  `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`, Cosmic Python guidance, slow
  development, frequent review, tests, live CLI checks, and small verified
  commits.
- Current branch is `codex/python-port-archive-existing-code`.
- Existing TypeScript/Node implementation is staged under `archive/code/`.
- Local Cosmic Python reference exists as Markdown-only files under
  `docs/reference/cosmic-python/`.
- Read `MANUAL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.almanac/README.md`,
  `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`, and the CodeAlmanac Cosmic Python
  guide.
- First implementation pressure is the Python spine: packaging, CLI entrypoint,
  application composition root, workspace service, and a test harness.

## Current Hypothesis

Start with the smallest useful spine, not with all product commands. A thin CLI
and composition root will make later services additive. The first slice should
prove that the repo can install, invoke `codealmanac`, initialize a `.almanac/`,
and run tests through service/CLI entrypoints.

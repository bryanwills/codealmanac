# Public Beta Gate Audit

Date: 2026-06-30

## Verdict

CodeAlmanac's local Python implementation has public-beta gate coverage. Slice
70 ran the remaining real lifecycle dogfood pass against a non-toy project
source shape and fixed the user-state path issue it exposed. Slice 71 reran
current-head package/install proof after that change. Slice 93 aligned GitHub
CI, package-check, disabled publish placeholders, and issue/PR templates with
the Python/PyPI surface. Remaining work is release operations: PyPI credentials,
versioning, changelog, and the human publish decision.

## Gate Audit

| Area | Status | Evidence | Remaining Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh install | Ready | Slice 71 built current-head wheel and sdist artifacts into `/tmp/codealmanac-release-slice71`, installed each into clean uv-managed Python 3.12.9 environments, and ran installed `codealmanac --help`, `init`, `search`, `show`, `topics`, `health`, `jobs`, `sync status`, `doctor`, `serve`, and `update --check`. Both artifacts wrote registry state under `~/.codealmanac/`. | No current implementation blocker; final publish still needs the human release decision. |
| Package metadata | Ready | Slice 71 ran `uv build`, `uvx twine check`, wheel metadata inspection, sdist inspection, and package-data assertions for README, Apache-2.0 license metadata, license file, server assets, manual files, prompts, and `core/paths.py`. The wheel README metadata includes `~/.codealmanac/`. | No current implementation blocker; re-run if package metadata changes before publish. |
| Public docs | Ready with guard | `tests/test_public_contract.py` rejects Node/npm install language, `almanac` aliases, hosted dashboard language, `absorb`, stale README examples, and old `~/.almanac` user-state language. Slices 64-66 dogfooded README scaffold, quickstart, and lifecycle source examples. Slice 70 documents `~/.codealmanac/` as the user state root. | Future docs edits must keep the public-contract guard current. |
| Release guide | Ready with guard | Slice 62 replaced the npm release guide with the Python/PyPI release flow and added public-contract tests rejecting npm release commands. | Final publish still needs the human release decision and PyPI credentials. |
| GitHub automation | Ready with guard | Slice 93 replaced Node/npm CI with Python 3.12 plus uv, pytest, ruff, CLI smoke, and diff hygiene. Package check now runs `uv build --out-dir dist` and `uvx twine check dist/*`. The disabled publish workflow names future PyPI policy instead of npm tokens, and GitHub templates ask for Python/CodeAlmanac details. | The publish workflow remains intentionally disabled until PyPI credentials, Trusted Publishing, and release provenance are decided. |
| Local wiki read path | Ready | Slice 61 clean-installed artifacts ran `init`, `search`, `show`, `topics`, `health`, `jobs`, `sync status`, `doctor`, and `serve`. Slices 64 and 65 dogfooded the README init/search/read path in fresh temp repos. | No current blocker; rerun clean install smoke before publish. |
| Lifecycle write path | Ready | Slice 57 ran real Codex ingest and fixed prompt/manual guidance after broken wikilinks. Slice 58 ran real Claude ingest and produced a health-clean wiki page with readable `jobs logs`. Slice 70 ran real Claude-backed `codealmanac ingest` against a focused temp repo containing source-runtime, filesystem adapter, ingest workflow, prompt, and live-agreement files; it created `source-runtime-flow.md`, left health clean, and produced readable job logs. Slice 136 ran the default real Codex app-server harness through `IngestWorkflow`, fixed blank text-delta handling, and reran to a `done` run with clean health. | More real-project dogfood will keep improving prompts, but no current implementation blocker remains for public beta. |
| Sync path | Ready | Slice 59 discovered a real temp Codex transcript, claimed it, ran real Claude-backed ingest, advanced the ledger, skipped unchanged transcript content on the second status run, and left CLI readback readable. | More transcript-provider diversity can improve confidence later, but the required local sync path has evidence. |
| Safety | Ready | Ingest/garden workflow tests, lifecycle mutation policy tests, harness failure-log tests, and slice 54 dogfood prove non-wiki mutation rejection, dirty app file preservation, and harness event recording before terminal errors. | Continue testing any new lifecycle writer or mutation path against the same safety invariant. |
| Viewer | Ready | Slice 60 browser-harness checked live `serve` desktop overview, page, topic, search, and file routes plus mobile page route with no horizontal overflow. | Future visual changes still require browser-harness. |
| Contract guards | Ready | Public-contract tests reject hosted verbs, compatibility aliases, public SDK/MCP modules, stale README install language, stale release guide language, stale next-agent brief slice numbers, and old user-state path language. They also pin `AppConfig()` default registry/config paths under `~/.codealmanac/`. | Keep adding contract tests when a product boundary becomes user-visible. |
| Release command | Ready | Slice 48 dogfooded non-editable pip and uv-tool installs. `codealmanac update --check` reports package-manager plans, and editable/source installs refuse mutation with a local development fix. | Scheduled update automation remains intentionally out of scope until notifier cadence, dismissal, and release-channel policy exist. |

## Next Release Work

1. Choose the release version and changelog.
2. Confirm PyPI credentials and publish ownership.
3. Rerun package/install smoke if any package data, README, prompt, manual, or
   server asset changes before publishing.

# Launch Decisions

Status: active.

## Accepted

- Product language uses **cloud**, not hosted.
- The old `usealmanac` repo will become `codealmanac-hosted`.
- `codealmanac-hosted` depends on `codealmanac`; `codealmanac` must not depend
  on `codealmanac-hosted`.
- Cloud is the default product experience.
- Local remains a real free/dev runtime with parallel architecture where useful.
- Cloud auth uses WorkOS/AuthKit as the long-term identity provider.
- Supabase may remain database/storage, but Supabase Auth is not the long-term
  cloud identity system.
- CodeAlmanac may create a fresh WorkOS application/environment instead of
  reusing the old `../almanac` app directly.
- A new WorkOS project named `codealmanac` exists and is the target for
  CodeAlmanac cloud auth.
- WorkOS uses one production environment for now. Do not design separate
  WorkOS dev/staging/prod environments until that is explicitly reopened.
- Confirmed WorkOS callback targets are
  `https://www.codealmanac.com/auth/callback` and
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.
- Launch AuthKit should present GitHub login only. Email/password, magic auth,
  and generic SSO should stay disabled unless explicitly reopened.
- Email verification is not part of launch login. If a user reaches an email
  verification or email/password path, treat it as a WorkOS/AuthKit
  configuration bug because CodeAlmanac requires GitHub OAuth to return GitHub
  provider tokens.
- Canonical wiki content lives in the repository.
- Query DB and control DB are separate.
- Cross-wiki links are sunset for cloud and local.
- Cloud and local share the engine request/result contract.
- Intelligence lives in prompts, not preprocessing pipelines.
- Source material is passed by reference, never by value. Workers receive paths,
  storage refs, ids, and artifact handles; they do not receive copied source
  blobs embedded into request payloads.
- Trusted provider libraries are preferred over hand-rolled implementations.
  When WorkOS/AuthKit, GitHub, Vercel, Render, Supabase, Modal, Doppler,
  PostHog, Autumn, or another trusted public library owns a flow, CodeAlmanac
  should follow the documented library path and avoid parallel product-owned
  paths unless a documented provider gap forces a narrow adapter.
- Concept hierarchy and dependency direction are part of correctness. A slice
  should name which layer owns each concept and should avoid flattening distinct
  concepts such as browser sessions, API bearer tokens, CLI tokens, and capture
  credentials into one vague auth bucket.
- GitHub provider OAuth tokens should be returned by WorkOS and captured in the
  AuthKit callback when present.
- `codealmanac setup` and `codealmanac login` should use WorkOS CLI Auth through
  a thin CodeAlmanac API wrapper. The wrapper exists so the CLI talks only to
  CodeAlmanac product endpoints while the backend delegates device
  authorization, token exchange, and refresh to WorkOS.
- CodeAlmanac should not invent durable human CLI tokens, refresh-token logic, or
  API-key storage when WorkOS provides the primitive. The CLI may store
  WorkOS-issued access and refresh tokens locally, and the backend maps WorkOS
  identity to CodeAlmanac product permissions.
- Do not add a public API-key product surface unless a concrete launch workflow
  needs it. If programmatic credentials are needed for capture, SDK, MCP, or
  automation, prefer WorkOS API Keys or the closest WorkOS machine credential
  primitive behind a CodeAlmanac API wrapper.
- Capture credentials must be WorkOS-backed auth/machine credentials rather than
  a separate long-term CodeAlmanac-owned token system. The capture surface may
  still expose CodeAlmanac-shaped issue/status/revoke endpoints.
- GitHub OAuth scopes stay narrow by default. `user:email` is required for
  sign-in identity; repo read/write operations should use GitHub App
  installation tokens and app permissions instead of broad user OAuth scopes.
- GitHub provider OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest in cloud SQL using
  `cryptography` Fernet/MultiFernet behind the `UsersStore` boundary.
- WorkOS Vault is deferred until CodeAlmanac has a product hierarchy where
  WorkOS organizations clearly own the GitHub accounts/repositories whose
  secrets are stored.
- Legacy plaintext GitHub provider-token columns are invalidated and dropped
  during launch migrations. They must not be renamed into ciphertext columns.
- Do not deploy after every small verified fix. Batch deploys after coherent
  infrastructure/functionality slices, especially when a Supabase migration and
  backend rollout must happen together.
- The public CLI is not the worker API.
- Bare `codealmanac` opens the cloud wiki for the current checkout.
- `codealmanac setup` is cloud onboarding.
- `codealmanac setup` must not install local trigger hooks; local trigger hooks
  belong under `codealmanac local setup`.
- `codealmanac uninstall` must not remove local run history or control DB data.
- `codealmanac local setup` is local maintenance setup.
- `codealmanac local setup` detects the current GitHub checkout, writes the
  repository and branch trigger policy to the local control DB, and installs
  local Git trigger hooks unless explicitly skipped.
- Browser onboarding owns product consent and repo policy.
- CLI owns local machine installation, provider probing, and capture hooks.
- Capture consent happens in browser; capture installation happens in CLI.
- Codex/Claude detection is useful and should be non-blocking.
- Maintained branch and delivery mode are one trigger policy row.
- Delivery mode is configured per branch.
- Cloud default delivery mode is commit.
- Local default delivery mode is commit.
- Public launch CLI should not expose `ingest` or `garden`.
- Manual `ingest` and `garden` remain available under the hidden
  `codealmanac dev` namespace for maintainers and agents.
- Local public maintenance command is `codealmanac local runs start`.
- `codealmanac local runs start` is a foreground manual run for the current
  configured checkout and branch.
- `codealmanac local runs start` records a `manual` trigger event and then runs
  the same local worker path used by Git hook triggers.
- Manual local runs can rerun on the same HEAD because local capture/source
  material can change without a Git commit.
- Manual local runs do not start a second run when the same branch already has
  a queued or running local run.
- Local trigger policy commands are repo-scoped to the current configured
  checkout and branch-targeted by argument.
- Local trigger policy commands mutate local control DB branch rows only; they
  do not install hooks, spawn workers, or run updates.
- Local delivery policy changes preserve trigger enabled/disabled state.
- CLI auto-update should happen without asking, using a safe background/next-run
  model.
- Existing Python auto-update libraries must be researched before custom update
  machinery is written.
- The first overnight execution priority is infrastructure and deployment, so
  the renamed cloud product exists on real providers before deeper feature work.
- The overnight run has two large halves: first build the CLI/API/frontend/
  backend product spine until it works together, then deliberately sharpen the
  codebase organization and naming around the settled product model.
- Codebase reorganization is in scope after the product spine works. Services,
  stores, DTOs, API routes, frontend modules, migrations, and package structure
  may be renamed or moved when the new shape is simpler and more truthful.
- Code quality is a first-class launch objective. Refactors should be done when
  they remove split-brain concepts, provider leakage, stale compatibility, or
  unclear ownership; they should not be done for motion alone.
- Other contributors may push to `codealmanac` or `codealmanac-hosted` while
  this launch run is active, especially for UX improvements. Treat those
  commits as collaborative input. Do not revert them merely because they are
  rough; inspect them, preserve the intended UX/product improvement, and fold
  them into the ongoing code-quality pass.
- If an incoming contributor change looks over-defensive, preserves the wrong
  product model, creates a parallel path, or solves the immediate symptom in a
  way that fights the long-term architecture, send a RelayForge/Discord alert
  before absorbing it silently. The alert should name the concern and the safer
  long-term direction.
- The README should preserve the old README's banner, feel, and core language
  while updating launch commands and product facts. Do not replace it with a
  generic marketing README.
- Public install UX should prefer a curl one-liner backed by the Python/PyPI
  package path. `uv tool install --python 3.12 codealmanac` remains the explicit
  manual path.
- Every coherent chunk must leave a testing record: commands, URLs, provider
  surfaces, results, deploy/run ids, and any surfaces that could not be tested
  without user action.
- Provider CLIs/APIs should be used where available for Vercel, Render,
  Supabase, Modal, Doppler, PostHog, Autumn, and GitHub.
- CodeAlmanac PyPI publishing uses PyPI Trusted Publishing through GitHub
  Actions and the official PyPA publish action. Do not add a PyPI token to
  Doppler or GitHub secrets for the standard release path.
- Supabase migrations can be rewritten/collapsed/repaired during this launch
  because there are no external customers yet.
- Rate limits are postponed. They remain necessary before broad public scale,
  but they are not part of the current product-first launch slice.
- `codealmanac-hosted` should initially pin `codealmanac` by git SHA.
- Cloud workers must call the model/engine API directly, not the human CLI.
- `codealmanac-hosted` is a literal rename/evolution of `usealmanac`.
- The current `usealmanac` frontend look and feel should be preserved unless a
  deliberate product/design decision changes it.
- Internal frontend structure may be refactored during the rename if it makes
  the hosted architecture cleaner.
- First-build prompt and manual resources use `init` naming:
  `operations/init.md` and `manual/init.md`.
- Public `codealmanac init` is the agent-backed first-build command.
- Public `codealmanac build` is removed from the launch CLI surface.
- Internal scaffold-only setup uses `app.workflows.init.initialize_workspace`.
- Render production backend secrets come from Doppler project `codealmanac`,
  config `prd`.
- RelayForge Discord updates use Doppler project `almanac`, config `dev`.
- Do not mix those Doppler targets when testing internal production API
  endpoints; the wrong internal secret should return `401`.
- Maintained branch triggers are the primary cloud finalization event for
  captured conversations. On a qualifying branch push, cloud claims completed
  ref-backed conversation turns for that repo/branch into a source bundle and
  starts a `ConversationBatchSource` run. If there is no source bundle, cloud
  falls back to a `BranchSource` run.
- Conversation-batch runs use the same per-branch delivery policy as branch
  runs. The old scheduler path must not hard-code commit delivery.
- Branch-triggered cloud runs are immutable snapshots. The worker must
  materialize the run's recorded `head_sha`, and when a range is needed it must
  fetch the recorded `before_sha`; it must not run against the live branch tip.
- Root `codealmanac setup` is cloud setup plus local agent instruction setup.
  It must not install local trigger hooks,
  inspect the current repo, run an update, or expose scheduler JSON fields.
  Local maintenance stays under explicit local/admin surfaces.

## Naming

- `runs` is the cloud execution word.
- `jobs` is the local execution word.
- `capture`, not `agents`, is the user-facing noun for conversation capture.
- `triggers` is the user-facing noun for maintained branch update policy.
- `repo list` replaces the confusing `repo`/`repos` split.

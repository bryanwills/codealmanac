# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, push, and RelayForge update.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 38 added cloud open handoff.

Implemented:

- hosted worktree at
  `/Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence`
- hosted branch `codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`
- hosted browser-session repository resolve route:
  `POST /api/repositories/resolve`
- hosted redirector routes:
  `/wiki/github/[owner]/[repo]` and `/setup/repo`
- CodeAlmanac `CloudOpenWorkflow`
- `DEFAULT_CLOUD_APP_URL = "https://codealmanac.com"`
- public CLI commands:
  `codealmanac`, `codealmanac open`, `codealmanac repo setup`, and
  `codealmanac repo open [activity|settings|github|github-app]`
- pushed hosted commit
  `ed7e765 feat: add cloud route handoff`
- CodeAlmanac commit: pending

Verified:

```text
cd /Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence/backend
uv run pytest tests/test_repositories_api_contract.py tests/test_cli_repositories_api_contract.py -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run python -m compileall src modal_app -q
uv run pytest -q

cd /Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence/frontend
npm run test:routes
npm run test:frontend
npm run lint
npm run build

cd /Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/codealmanac
uv run pytest tests/test_cloud_open_workflow.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_architecture.py -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run python -m compileall src -q
uv run pytest -q
```

Counts so far: hosted backend focused `13 passed, 1 warning`; hosted
backend full `327 passed, 1 warning`; hosted frontend route tests `27 passed`;
hosted frontend component tests `44 passed`; CodeAlmanac focused `125 passed`;
CodeAlmanac full `496 passed`. Hosted build passed with the known CSS optimizer
warning about `m-* utility`.

## Next Pressure Test

Choose the next launch-hardening slice between terminal run fanout,
cloud run start/cancel/retry semantics, richer frontend onboarding pages, and
deployment/provider rename checks.

Pressure points:

- terminal failed/stale runs still do not have a dedicated `RunFailed` or
  `RunStale` domain-event fanout for GitHub check updates
- CLI commands list/show/log cloud runs, but do not start/cancel/retry them
- browser setup/onboarding entrypoints now have stable redirect URLs, but
  richer onboarding screens still need product UI
- old inline-message conversation routes should remain compatibility-only

The local wiki command currently fails on this checkout with:

```text
almanac: table pages has no column named archived_at
```

Use source files and launch docs as the authority until the wiki index health is
repaired.

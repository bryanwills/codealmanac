# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, push, and RelayForge update.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 37 added cloud run CLI mirrors.

Implemented:

- hosted worktree at
  `/Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence`
- hosted branch `codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`
- hosted CLI-token run read routes:
  `GET /v1/repositories/{repo_id}/runs`,
  `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}`, and
  `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/events`
- CodeAlmanac `cloud_runs` service and typed HTTP adapter methods
- current-checkout cloud run workflow for listing repo runs
- run-id-only cloud run detail and log workflows
- public CLI commands:
  `codealmanac runs list`,
  `codealmanac runs show <run-id>`, and
  `codealmanac runs logs <run-id>`
- pushed hosted commit
  `168f9b2 feat: add CLI run read routes`

Verified:

```text
cd /Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence/backend
uv run pytest tests/test_cli_runs_api_contract.py tests/test_repositories_api_contract.py tests/test_updates_contract.py -q
uv run ruff check .

cd /Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/codealmanac

uv run pytest -q
```

Counts: hosted backend focused `40 passed, 1 warning`; hosted backend full
`326 passed, 1 warning`; CodeAlmanac focused `121 passed`; CodeAlmanac full
`490 passed`.

## Next Pressure Test

Choose the next launch-hardening slice between terminal run fanout,
setup/onboarding entrypoints, cloud run start/cancel/retry semantics, and
frontend onboarding changes.

Pressure points:

- terminal failed/stale runs still do not have a dedicated `RunFailed` or
  `RunStale` domain-event fanout for GitHub check updates
- CLI commands list/show/log cloud runs, but do not start/cancel/retry them
- browser setup/onboarding entrypoints still need the new cloud setup flow
- old inline-message conversation routes should remain compatibility-only

The local wiki command currently fails on this checkout with:

Use source files and launch docs as the authority until the wiki index health is
repaired.

# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, push, and RelayForge update.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 36 added cloud repository trigger CLI mirrors.

Implemented:

- hosted worktree at
  `/Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence`
- hosted branch `codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`
- hosted CLI-token routes:
  `POST /v1/repositories/resolve`,
  `GET /v1/repositories/{repo_id}/triggers`, and
  `PUT /v1/repositories/{repo_id}/triggers`
- direct repo-id repository trigger service methods for CLI auth
- CodeAlmanac `cloud_repositories` service and typed HTTP adapter methods
- current-checkout `cloud_repo` workflow that resolves GitHub `origin`
- public CLI commands:
  `codealmanac repo status`,
  `codealmanac repo triggers list`,
  `codealmanac repo triggers enable <branch> --delivery pr|commit`,
  `codealmanac repo triggers disable <branch>`, and
  `codealmanac repo delivery set --branch <branch> --mode pr|commit`
- pushed hosted commit
  `fbf8b5a feat: add CLI repository trigger routes`

Verified:

`324 passed, 1 warning`; CodeAlmanac focused `57 passed`; CodeAlmanac full
`487 passed`.

## Next Pressure Test

Choose the next launch-hardening slice between terminal run fanout,
setup/onboarding entrypoints, cloud run CLI mirrors, and full verification for
the new CLI routes.

Pressure points:

- terminal failed/stale runs still do not have a dedicated `RunFailed` or
  `RunStale` domain-event fanout for GitHub check updates
- CLI commands do not yet list/start/cancel/retry cloud runs
- browser setup/onboarding entrypoints still need the new cloud setup flow
- old inline-message conversation routes should remain compatibility-only

## Known Repo State

The CodeAlmanac branch is `dev`. Slice 31 is pushed to `origin/dev` at
`f20e928d feat: expose maintenance package api`. Slice 36 has been committed
locally as `feat: mirror cloud repository triggers in CLI`; record the final
pushed hash after push because amending this file changes the commit hash.

The hosted auth branch is
`/Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence`
on `codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`. Slice 27 is pushed to origin at
`c91e162 feat: add v1 CLI auth routes`; Slice 28 is pushed to origin at

The local wiki command currently fails on this checkout with:

```text
almanac: table pages has no column named archived_at
```

Use source files and launch docs as the authority until the wiki index health is
repaired.

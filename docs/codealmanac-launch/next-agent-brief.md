# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, and push.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 10 added branch-head staling.

Implemented:

- `app.control.get_run(...)`
- staling of queued/running runs when a newer trigger arrives for the same
  branch with a different expected head
- normalized stale run events
- preservation of terminal runs
- preservation of queued/running runs already targeting the new head
- removal of unused `EnsureControlSchemaRequest`

Verified:

```text
uv run pytest tests/test_control_service.py tests/test_architecture.py
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
git diff --check
```

## Next Pressure Test

Choose the next substantial slice from the launch plan. Good candidates:

- local trigger event recording through Git hooks
- public or hidden setup command that calls `app.local_hooks`
- local run storage bridge from repo-local job files to the control DB
- source bundle selection materialization for claimed runs
- local model worker execution from prepared `EngineRunRequest`
- delivery commit application from `EngineRunResult`

Before coding, write the next slice plan under `docs/plans/`, then implement
the full slice, update this brief, update `progress.md`, send a RelayForge
progress update, commit, and push.

## Known Repo State

The branch is `dev`. At the start of Slice 10 it was clean and even with
`origin/dev`.

The local wiki command currently fails on this checkout with:

```text
almanac: table pages has no column named archived_at
```

Use source files and launch docs as the authority until the wiki index health is
repaired.

# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, and push.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 5 added SQL-backed control run records and ordered run events.

Implemented:

- `app.control.create_run(...)`
- `app.control.update_run(...)`
- `app.control.append_run_event(...)`
- `app.control.list_run_events(...)`
- launch run statuses: `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `stale`,
  `cancelled`
- launch run event kinds: `status`, `message`, `tool`, `output`, `error`
- ordered per-run event sequences starting at `1`

Verified:

```text
uv run pytest tests/test_control_service.py tests/test_architecture.py
uv run ruff check .
git diff --check
```

## Next Pressure Test

Choose the next substantial slice from the launch plan. Good candidates:

- local trigger event recording through Git hooks
- public or hidden setup command that calls `app.local_hooks`
- local run storage bridge from repo-local job files to the control DB
- trigger-event claim/lock behavior that creates or starts run rows
- engine request/result models used by local and hosted workers

Before coding, write the next slice plan under `docs/plans/`, then implement
the full slice and update this brief.

## Known Repo State

The branch is `dev` and is behind `origin/dev` by one commit. Rebase or merge
before pushing if Git requires it.

The local wiki command currently fails on this checkout with:

```text
almanac: table pages has no column named archived_at
```

Use source files and launch docs as the authority until the wiki index health is
repaired.

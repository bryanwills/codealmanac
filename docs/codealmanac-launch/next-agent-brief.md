# Next Agent Brief

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-02.

## Current Hypothesis

Build the launch in substantial slices. Each slice needs a plan, code, focused
verification, launch-folder updates, commit, push, and RelayForge update.

## Last Completed Slice

Slice 49 hardened hosted GitHub provider-token storage.

Implemented:

- hosted worktree at
  `/Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence`
- hosted branch `codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`
- `users.oauth_token` / `users.refresh_token` became
  `oauth_token_ciphertext` / `refresh_token_ciphertext`
- `backend/src/almanac/services/identity/users/secrets.py` defines the
  Fernet/MultiFernet token-cipher boundary
- `UsersStore` encrypts provider tokens on write and decrypts them when
  hydrating the domain `User`
- `backend/src/almanac/app.py` wires the concrete cipher from
  `Settings.github_token_encryption_keys`
- WorkOS issuer normalization now uses the documented slash form
  `https://api.workos.com/`
- Supabase migrations invalidate/drop legacy plaintext token columns instead
  of renaming them into ciphertext columns
- Modal Doppler hydration and `frontend/package.json` backend smoke both know
  `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`
- production Doppler `codealmanac/prd` has `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`
  created; the key value was not printed
- hosted commit `0f9850c refactor: encrypt github provider tokens` is pushed to
  `origin/codex/workos-authkit-api-foundation`
- hosted `main` was not fast-forwarded and no deploy was triggered for Slice 49

Verified:

```text
cd /Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence/backend
uv run pytest tests/test_capture_upload_api_contract.py tests/test_hosted_conversation_sync_contract.py tests/test_identity_auth_contract.py tests/test_store_timestamps_contract.py tests/test_architecture_contract.py -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q
uv run python -m compileall src modal_app -q
uv run ruff format --check <touched Python files>

cd /Users/rohan/.config/superpowers/worktrees/usealmanac/hosted-baseline-convergence/frontend
npm run test:routes
npm run lint
npm run backend:smoke
```

Counts for Slice 49: focused backend tests `99 passed, 1 warning`; full
backend tests `361 passed, 1 warning`; frontend routes `27 passed`; focused
Modal hydration test `1 passed`; backend smoke succeeded. Full repo
`uv run ruff format --check .` still reports a pre-existing unrelated format
drift in `src/almanac/services/updates/service.py`; touched Python files pass
format check.

## Next Pressure Test

Choose a coherent next batch before any deploy. Good candidates are real
authenticated browser verification, provider cleanup, Supabase migration
application plus Render/Vercel deployment, or setup CTA refinement.

Pressure points:

- Do not apply the Slice 49 Supabase migration without deploying the backend
  that understands `oauth_token_ciphertext`; migration and backend rollout
  should land in the same batched deploy gate.
- Rohan explicitly asked not to deploy too frequently. Deploy after a larger
  verified infrastructure/functionality batch, not after every small fix.
- new steering rule: concept hierarchy and dependency direction are part of
  correctness; do not flatten browser sessions, API bearer tokens, CLI tokens,
  and capture credentials into one vague auth bucket
- the repository setup summary is live, but it has not been exercised through a
  real signed-in production browser session in this slice
- setup CTAs may need one more pass so browser setup and CLI setup do not feel
  like competing paths
- old inline-message conversation routes should remain compatibility-only
- old Modal app `usealmanac-updates` is still deployed; retire it only in an
  explicit provider cleanup step
- dirty `/Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/usealmanac` still exists and should not
  be used for launch work until cleaned or renamed

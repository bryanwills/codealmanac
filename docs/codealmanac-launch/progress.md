This file tracks the rough percentage estimates used in RelayForge updates.
Percentages are planning estimates, not accounting metrics.

## Latest RelayForge Update

Sent: 2026-07-04 after Slice 93 local architecture cleanup.

Route:

```bash
doppler run --project almanac --config dev -- \
  relayforge reply \
  "Slice 93 verified locally. CodeAlmanac architecture quality is now ~91% ..." \
  --config /Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/relayforge/relay.config.json
```

Result: `sent via rohan-codex-019f05b3`.

Slice 91 published `codealmanac` `0.1.11` from `main` through GitHub Actions
run `28692015106`. Public install smoke passed with `uv tool install --python
3.12 --refresh --no-cache --force codealmanac==0.1.11`; the installed CLI
returned `0.1.11`, rejected old root `jobs`, `__capture-hook`, and
`__run-worker`, exposed `codealmanac capture inspect`, and installed private
`codealmanac-capture-hook`, `codealmanac-job-worker`,
`codealmanac-local-trigger`, and `codealmanac-local-worker` scripts.

Follow-up release `0.1.12` is live on PyPI from GitHub Actions run
`28694070925`. It makes `codealmanac setup` install cloud capture as part of
setup, while `codealmanac capture enable` remains a manual repair command.
Fresh `uvx --python 3.12 --refresh --no-cache --from codealmanac==0.1.12`
smoke returned version `0.1.12` and showed the updated setup help.
Hosted `main` was fast-forwarded to `748c8ed` and Vercel deploy run
`28694096088` succeeded.

Slice 92 is local architecture cleanup, not a new public package release. It
renamed the local viewer HTTP edge from `codealmanac.server` to
`codealmanac.api`, updated wheel asset packaging, and passed the local
source/package gates.

Slice 93 is local architecture cleanup, not a new public package release. It
removed the generic `src/codealmanac/services/` bucket and moved the remaining
modules into `config`, `diagnostics`, `cloud/setup`, `wiki/tagging`, and
`maintenance/updates`.

## Latest Local Notes

2026-07-03 provider correction:

- Vercel production was re-linked to project `thealmanac/codealmanac-hosted`
  and redeployed. `https://www.codealmanac.com` now serves deployment
  `dpl_BNAWQDiWydrtXUXfM1D4f61FiwCB`.
- Hosted Modal app `codealmanac-hosted-updates` was redeployed with the current
  `codealmanac` git SHA. Modal image logs showed `codealmanac 0.1.9`.
- Architecture cleanup notes now live under
  `docs/refactor-audit-2026-07-03-hosted-local-architecture/`.
- Slice 81 implemented the first CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  `services/cloud_* + workflows/cloud_* -> cloud/`.
- Slice 82 implemented the next CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  wiki files, workspaces, index, search, pages, topics, health, and viewer now
  live under `src/codealmanac/wiki/`.
- Slice 83 implemented the next CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  harness contracts, sources, source bundles, engine workspaces, page-run
  execution, and lifecycle helpers now live under `src/codealmanac/engine/`.
- Slice 84 implemented the next CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  local control DB, hooks, delivery, run preparation/execution/jobs/worker,
  policies, setup, status, and update now live under `src/codealmanac/local/`.
- Slice 85 implemented the job-ledger naming cleanup from that audit:
  repo-local lifecycle jobs now live under `src/codealmanac/jobs/ledger/` and
  `src/codealmanac/jobs/queue/`, while branch-triggered local/cloud executions
  remain `runs`.
- Slice 86 implemented the engine runtime cleanup from that audit:
  model-worker request/result artifacts now live under `src/codealmanac/engine/runs/`,
  detached engine workspaces live under `src/codealmanac/engine/workspaces/`,
  and local run workflows use the `app.engine` facade.
- Slice 92 renamed the local viewer HTTP edge from `server` to `api`.
- Slice 93 retired the remaining active generic `services/` package.

## Percentages

| Area | Latest | Previous | Basis |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CodeAlmanac backend/local | 100% | 100% | Slice 89 removed the old sync/automation implementation path and aligned local execution/history on `local runs`; Slice 90 public smoke verified the packaged private local trigger/worker entrypoints. |
| CodeAlmanac CLI/public UX | 100% | 99% | `0.1.12` is live on PyPI and fresh public `uvx` smoke verified the setup/capture contract. `codealmanac setup` owns capture installation; `capture enable` is manual repair/admin surface. |
| CodeAlmanac-hosted backend/auth/API | 100% | 100% | Slice 75 added production `/v1/repositories`; production repo list and repo status pass without per-repo permission fanout. |
| Hosted frontend/onboarding | 100% | 99% | Hosted `main` is at `748c8ed`; Vercel deploy run `28694096088` succeeded with setup/onboarding copy aligned to `codealmanac setup` owning capture. |
| Infra/deploy rename | 100% | 100% | Vercel targets `thealmanac/codealmanac-hosted`, Render `/api/health` is live, Modal `codealmanac-hosted-updates` was redeployed earlier, and PyPI `codealmanac` `0.1.12` is live. |
| Codebase architecture quality | 91% | 88% | Slice 93 removed the remaining active generic `services/` package, moved modules to named domains, and added a guard against reintroducing `codealmanac.services`. Remaining quality work is broader refinement and live signed-in verification. |

## Update Rule

After each verified slice:

1. Move the old `Latest` values into `Previous`.
2. Set new `Latest` values.
3. Send the same values through RelayForge.
4. Record command success or failure in the worklog.

# Worklog

## 2026-07-06

- Started from `f2eb2c7a1ac56c913d4a44ab24d5c3a2b553007c` on branch
  `codex/macro-refactor-from-f2eb2c7`.
- Removed an accidental temporary worktree and continued in the main checkout
  as requested.
- Read the active build rules in `MANUAL.md`.
- Read the wiki front door and style pages under `almanac/style/`.
- Read the active live agreement in `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`.
- Read local Cosmic Python notes and the project-structure appendix.
- Ran baseline gates:
  - `uv run pytest`: 401 passed.
  - `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
- Captured initial size pressure:
  - `src/codealmanac/cli/render/setup.py`: 612 lines.
  - `src/codealmanac/app.py`: 255 lines.
  - `src/codealmanac/integrations/harnesses/codex/app_server.py`: 238 lines.
  - `src/codealmanac/workflows/sync/execution.py`: 232 lines.
  - `src/codealmanac/workflows/sync/evaluation.py`: 230 lines.
  - `src/codealmanac/services/runs/store.py`: 228 lines.
- Found that many facade modules are intentional and documented in the live
  agreement. This audit should not blindly delete them.
- Found a live-agreement tension: an older config section says not to add a
  public `config` command, while the current CLI, tests, and README expose
  `codealmanac config set`. This is recorded in `product-slop.md` instead of
  being changed during refactor.

## Current Pressure Points

- `cli/render/setup.py` mixes terminal art, interactive choice screens,
  ANSI-card layout helpers, setup result rendering, and uninstall Rich panels.
- `app.py` wires every concrete dependency directly in one function. It is
  still honest as the composition root, but it is becoming hard to scan.
- Architecture tests are useful, but many assert exact files and fragments.
  During refactor they should describe boundaries, not fossilize accidental
  names.
- Several product behaviors now exist because they are tested and documented,
  not because the live agreement explains their final product value clearly.
  These belong in `product-slop.md`.

## First Refactor Batch: Setup Render Split

- Wrote `docs/plans/2026-07-06-setup-render-refactor.md`.
- Split `src/codealmanac/cli/render/setup.py` by reason to change:
  - `brand.py` owns banner/color/product-label constants and banner output.
  - `terminal.py` owns ANSI-aware width, wrapping, card rows, and shell command
    rendering.
  - `setup_screens.py` owns interactive setup choice screens.
  - `setup_panels.py` owns Rich uninstall panels.
  - `setup.py` now owns setup-result text rendering and setup step facts.
- Updated `src/codealmanac/cli/dispatch/setup_tui.py` to import interactive
  setup screen types from `setup_screens.py`.
- Updated `tests/test_architecture.py` so the CLI admin render boundary guards
  the new split and caps `setup.py`.
- Size evidence after split:
  - `setup.py`: 225 lines, down from 612.
  - `setup_screens.py`: 182 lines.
  - `setup_panels.py`: 105 lines.
  - `brand.py`: 75 lines.
  - `terminal.py`: 74 lines.
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py tests/test_setup_service.py tests/test_architecture.py -q`: 114 passed.
  - `uv run ruff check src/codealmanac/cli/render src/codealmanac/cli/dispatch/setup_tui.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_setup_service.py tests/test_architecture.py`: passed.
  - `uv run pytest`: 401 passed.
  - `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
  - `git diff --check`: passed after removing one final blank line.

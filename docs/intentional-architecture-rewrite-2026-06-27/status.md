# Intentional Architecture Rewrite Status

Date: 2026-06-28
Branch: `codex/intentional-architecture-rewrite`

## Current State

The branch has more than 280 committed rewrite commits past `dev`. The worklog records 262 production slices so far.

The diff is broad: more than 490 files changed, with tens of thousands of lines reshaped.

This is no longer a small cleanup branch. It is a real ownership rewrite.

## Done

- Created the rewrite contract and branch-specific worklog.
- Added explicit CLI app composition under `src/app/cli-runtime.ts` for concrete lifecycle and sync runtime wiring.
- Added explicit automation app composition under `src/app/automation-runtime.ts` for launchd scheduler wiring.
- Moved bundled operation prompt file mechanics into `src/platform/prompts.ts`, with lifecycle services receiving an injected prompt loader.
- Moved setup instruction file mechanics into `src/platform/setup/instructions.ts`, with setup services receiving an injected setup instruction runtime.
- Moved CLI process execution and command registration into `src/edges/cli/`.
- Split query command registration into per-command edge files for serve, search, show, health, and list.
- Split lifecycle run command registration into per-operation edge files for init, absorb/ingest, and Garden.
- Split setup-family command registration into per-command edge files for setup, doctor, update, and uninstall.
- Split topic command registration into read, create, graph-edge, and page-mutation edge files.
- Split wiki topic graph mutations into create-topic and edge-mutation service files.
- Split review command registration into add, read, decision, and markdown-input edge files.
- Split automation command registration into install, uninstall, status, and task-input edge files.
- Split jobs command registration into read, log/attach, and cancel edge files.
- Split sync command registration into run, status, and runtime-input edge files.
- Made CLI command files much thinner by moving product workflows into `src/services/`.
- Moved remaining command adapters, renderers, and command output helpers from the old top-level `src/cli/` directory into `src/edges/cli/commands/`.
- Split wiki workflows into clearer service boundaries: search, show, health, registry, topics, review, reindex, source migration, and doctor wiki checks.
- Moved topic-read page lookup SQL and indexed-topic existence SQL into the wiki query store so topic services no longer own query mechanics.
- Moved viewer overview count SQL and `topics.yaml` existence checks into stores, so viewer read models compose route payloads over store-owned facts.
- Moved durable job persistence into explicit stores for records, specs, logs, and worker locks.
- Removed the old top-level `src/jobs/` source bucket; job runtime and projections now live under `src/services/jobs/`, durable job schemas live under `src/stores/jobs/`, and detached worker spawning lives under `src/platform/jobs/`.
- Split the old public `src/services/jobs/jobs.ts` bucket into owned read, log, cancel, and repo-root service files.
- Moved job record lifecycle and display-status read-model helpers out of the job runtime folder, and put public job record/log reads behind the `src/stores/jobs/` store API.
- Renamed the job service view mapper away from runtime terminology so it explicitly maps store-owned job views into service views.
- Removed raw log-file reads from job projections; stores own job log contents while projections parse contents into viewer/job read models.
- Moved detached job-worker process startup behind an edge-composed background starter; job services now queue records/specs/logs and consume an injected worker starter.
- Moved job page snapshot file reads and page hashing into `src/stores/wiki-files/`.
- Moved repo `.almanac` path construction and nearest-wiki-root discovery into `src/stores/wiki-files/repo-location.ts`.
- Moved registry path reachability checks into `src/stores/wiki-registry/`.
- Moved global viewer registry browseability decisions into wiki registry services over store-owned wiki-root checks.
- Moved registry path case-sensitivity detection into `src/platform/path-case.ts`.
- Moved global state path and registry path construction into `src/stores/global-paths.ts` and `src/stores/wiki-registry/paths.ts`, deleting the old top-level `src/paths.ts`.
- Moved cross-cutting slug, user-facing error, and ANSI theme helper contracts into `src/shared/`, deleting the old root-level helper files.
- Removed the mixed `src/services/jobs/runtime/index.ts` compatibility barrel; callers now import concrete runtime, store, platform, or record-lifecycle modules.
- Removed the old top-level `src/init/` source bucket; wiki initialization now lives under `src/services/wiki/`, and mechanical `.almanac/` file scaffolding, page-file counting, and absorb-log scanning live under `src/stores/wiki-files/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/config/` source bucket; persisted config mechanics now live under `src/stores/config/`, service verbs live under `src/services/config/`, and provider enablement policy lives under `src/shared/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/wiki/` source bucket; local wiki index, query, health, topic-file, and source-frontmatter mechanics now live under `src/stores/wiki/`.
- Moved topic page rewrite scanning and frontmatter read mechanics into `src/stores/wiki/topics/`.
- Removed the `src/services/viewer/` service bucket; viewer-only route read models now live under `src/edges/viewer/read-model/`.
- Moved the interactive setup and uninstall terminal UI out of `src/cli/commands/` and into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving setup services as the product workflow owner.
- Moved `almanac serve` process lifetime and startup rendering into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving viewer server code as the HTTP/static route owner.
- Moved the hidden internal job worker entrypoint into `src/edges/worker/`; queued job draining remains a job service runtime workflow.
- Moved sync ledger and lock persistence into explicit stores.
- Moved local Claude/Codex transcript discovery, transcript snapshot reads, and timestamp boundary parsing into `src/platform/transcripts/` and removed the old top-level `src/sync/` source bucket.
- Moved sync-facing transcript contracts and cursor boundary calculation into `src/shared/transcripts.ts`, leaving platform transcript modules focused on discovery and file reads.
- Moved the sync transcript runtime port into `src/shared/transcripts.ts`, so platform transcript runtime no longer imports sync service types.
- Moved transcript-to-repo enrichment into sync services, so platform transcript discovery returns raw discovered transcript facts without importing wiki-file stores.
- Moved concrete transcript discovery/snapshot composition behind an injected sync transcript runtime contract, with `src/platform/transcripts/runtime.ts` wired by the CLI sync edge.
- Moved sync's internal-Almanac-session lookup behind a jobs-service provider-session helper, so sync no longer reads job record storage shape directly.
- Split sync workflow helpers into owned files for input parsing, transcript candidate shaping, summary projection, and Absorb context rendering.
- Split sync sweep helpers into owned files for candidate eligibility, internal-session detection, and Absorb enqueue/ledger transitions.
- Moved lifecycle operation construction and Absorb input/source handling into `src/services/lifecycle/` and removed the old top-level `src/operations/` and `src/absorb/` source buckets.
- Normalized lifecycle operation failures into lifecycle-owned result contracts before command rendering sees them.
- Moved init prompt context construction out of the operation command adapter and into lifecycle workflows, so command code only shapes flags into service requests and renders service results.
- Split lifecycle workflow contracts out of `src/services/lifecycle/workflows.ts` into `src/services/lifecycle/workflow-types.ts`, so the workflow implementation reads as product policy instead of a mixed API/type bucket.
- Moved raw config-key validation for config get/set/unset into config services, so config command code only passes raw input and renders service result statuses.
- Split the old `src/services/config/config.ts` bucket into config read, write, and type files so config service verbs have separate owners.
- Moved review markdown cleanup and missing-markdown classification fully into wiki review services, so review commands only choose the raw input source.
- Moved worker-program shape into `src/shared/worker-program.ts` so lifecycle services no longer import platform worker-process mechanics.
- Reshaped update install injection so update services accept typed install results while platform update modules own npm child-process mechanics.
- Moved update state and install-lock persistence into `src/stores/update/`; platform update modules now own registry/npm/version behavior, not JSON state-file mechanics.
- Moved update registry/version/install mechanics behind a service-owned `UpdateRuntime` contract, with the real runtime composed in the CLI edge.
- Moved update check/cache workflow into `src/services/update/check.ts`, registry fetch mechanics into `src/platform/update/check.ts`, and concrete runtime composition into `src/app/update-runtime.ts`.
- Moved update notifier/banner eligibility into `src/services/update/notifier.ts`, CLI banner rendering into `src/edges/cli/update-announcement.ts`, and detached update-check process spawning into `src/platform/update/notifier-worker.ts`.
- Removed the update banner edge's direct platform version read; run-level CLI composition now supplies the installed version from `createUpdateRuntime()`.
- Moved update diagnostic status reads into `src/services/diagnostics/update-status.ts`, leaving platform diagnostics for external/auth/install/automation probes.
- Moved GitHub source resolution mechanics into `src/platform/github/`.
- Moved Absorb source resolver composition into `src/platform/sources/absorb.ts` and the CLI edge, so lifecycle Absorb services no longer import platform GitHub mechanics.
- Moved Absorb source-ref and resolved-source contracts into `src/shared/absorb-sources.ts`, so platform source resolvers no longer import lifecycle service-internal Absorb files.
- Moved provider execution runtime into `src/agent/runtime/`, especially Claude and Codex app-server mechanics, and made provider runtime environment flow through explicit job/registry contracts.
- Split Claude SDK process mechanics out of the SDK option mapper and runtime coordinator.
- Moved Claude auth probing from the generic `src/agent/auth/` bucket into provider-owned `src/agent/providers/claude/auth.ts`.
- Moved generic provider CLI status process mechanics into `src/platform/agent-cli-status.ts`, so Codex/Cursor readiness and Codex runtime status share one platform-owned command runner.
- Split Codex app-server process mechanics out of the JSON-RPC runtime coordinator.
- Split Codex app-server agent-message handling out of the generic notification router.
- Split Codex app-server terminal event handling out of the generic notification router.
- Moved setup, diagnostics, update, automation, jobs, sync, lifecycle, config, and agents workflows behind service-owned contracts.
- Moved diagnostic probe mechanics into `src/platform/diagnostics/`, while `src/services/diagnostics/` now owns only doctor read models and service-facing re-exports.
- Moved diagnostic fact contracts into `src/shared/diagnostics.ts`, so platform probes and diagnostics services meet through a neutral contract instead of a service-to-platform type import.
- Moved doctor diagnostic runtime composition into `src/app/diagnostics-runtime.ts`, so doctor command registration owns process facts but not concrete probe wiring.
- Moved Claude auth diagnostic wiring into `src/app/diagnostic-auth.ts`, so platform diagnostics no longer import provider auth modules.
- Moved setup provider fix-command normalization/execution into `src/services/setup/provider-fix-command.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform shell mechanics.
- Moved setup global-install state/execution into `src/services/setup/global-install.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform package-manager mechanics.
- Moved setup runtime ports into `src/shared/setup-runtime.ts`, so platform setup mechanics no longer import setup service files for contract types.
- Moved setup shell/global-install mechanics behind `src/platform/setup/runtime.ts`, so setup services own contracts/results while the CLI setup edge owns concrete runtime composition.
- Split setup agent-choice services into state persistence, setup-specific contracts, provider-view mapping, and selection validation files.
- Moved setup plan defaults and gate-selection policy into `src/services/setup/setup-plan.ts`, leaving the CLI setup edge to collect terminal answers and render steps.
- Split the automation task catalog out of platform launchd mechanics: task meaning/defaults live under `src/services/automation/tasks.ts`, while plist/log paths live under `src/platform/automation/paths.ts`.
- Moved the automation scheduler port into `src/shared/automation-scheduler.ts`, so launchd platform mechanics no longer import automation services.
- Moved automation scheduler mechanics behind the shared scheduler port, with launchd implementation in `src/platform/automation/scheduler.ts`; automation services no longer import `src/platform/automation/`.
- Split automation install planning into task selection, task schedule validation, scheduler-job construction, and top-level install-plan orchestration files.
- Moved concrete agent runtime provider registry creation out of job runtime services; CLI and worker edges now inject an `AgentRuntimeRunner`, while `src/agent/runtime/job-runner.ts` owns provider-registry composition.
- Moved the provider-neutral agent runner contract into `src/shared/agent-runtime/runner.ts`, deleting the old job-runtime-private contract file.
- Moved provider identity and provider-neutral runtime event/final-output/tool contracts into `src/shared/`, so services and stores no longer import provider runtime contract files from `src/agent/runtime/`.
- Moved provider enablement policy into `src/shared/agent-provider-enablement.ts` and provider setup/readiness view construction into `src/services/agents/`, leaving `src/agent/readiness/providers/` focused on provider status probing.
- Moved provider readiness/model-choice contracts into `src/shared/agent-readiness.ts` and concrete readiness wiring into `src/app/agent-readiness-runtime.ts`, so provider setup views consume an injected runtime instead of importing provider internals.
- Split the former provider setup-view bucket into provider setup-view, model-choice, recommendation, selection, readiness, catalog, and type files under `src/services/agents/`.
- Split the old `src/services/agents/agents.ts` bucket into owned service files for agents read views, default-provider writes, provider-model writes, and config-write mechanics.
- Removed setup's duplicate spawned-process contract; setup now aliases the shared agent readiness spawn contract.
- Removed the stale wiki indexer `total` compatibility alias; `pagesIndexed` is now the single result contract name through indexer, reindex service, CLI adapter, and renderer.
- Split the monolithic architecture boundary test file into subsystem-owned boundary test files, so the guardrails now follow the same ownership map as `src/`.
- Moved the SQLite ABI startup guard into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving root `src/` with only the intentional stable CLI facade.
- Removed platform path-case mechanics from registry stores and wiki services; CLI/app composition now injects current-platform registry path equality.
- Moved wiki command target resolution into `src/services/wiki/wiki-root.ts`, deleting the old indexer-store resolver path.
- Moved cross-wiki health reachability classification into wiki health services, leaving wiki health stores to report indexed cross-wiki link facts.
- Moved the provider-neutral operation spec contract into `src/shared/operation-spec.ts`, so lifecycle services build specs, job stores persist them, and provider adapters execute them without stores or providers importing lifecycle service internals.
- Moved worker-lock and sync-lock process ownership/liveness facts out of stores; stores now persist lock files over injected owner PID and liveness contracts while CLI/worker edges provide platform process probes.
- Moved repeated store atomic-write temp-file mechanics into `src/stores/atomic-write.ts`, removing process-PID temp names from job and sync stores.
- Split most command rendering into command-private render files.
- Added architecture-boundary tests to stop old dependency leaks from returning.
- Ran repeated lint, focused tests, full test suites, builds, CLI smokes, and review passes across the branch.

## Remaining

- Continue removing ambient runtime state from non-edge layers.
- Continue checking for service files that still know too much about platform, provider, or CLI mechanics.
- Continue checking for command files that still own workflow decisions instead of request shaping and rendering.
- Review large files that remain large because of mixed ownership, not because the domain is naturally dense.
- Continue subsystem-level passes before small leak cleanup.
- Run another broad review pass over the full branch before calling the rewrite merge-ready.

## Latest Checkpoint

The latest slice moved cross-wiki health reachability classification from `src/stores/wiki/health/link-checks.ts` into `src/services/wiki/health.ts`. Wiki health stores now return indexed cross-wiki link facts, while the wiki health service coordinates registry lookup and exposes the public `broken_xwiki` report shape.

## Immediate Next Work

Continue top-down subsystem passes before small leak cleanup. The major loose source buckets for jobs, init, config, wiki, viewer read models, worker entrypoints, serve process lifetime, setup/uninstall terminal UI, wiki file mechanics, automation scheduler mechanics, automation scheduler app composition, setup instruction runtime composition, provider setup-view ownership, job provider-runner composition, job-worker process spawning, Absorb source resolver composition, Absorb source contract ownership, prompt loader mechanics, update runtime composition, update notifier ownership, setup runtime composition, sync transcript runtime composition, sync-to-job session lookup, CLI app composition, diagnostic fact contracts, provider-neutral agent runtime contracts, lock process-liveness contracts, operation-spec type ownership, init prompt-context ownership, config command validation ownership, store atomic-write ownership, review command markdown ownership, lifecycle workflow type ownership, path construction ownership, shared helper-contract ownership, wiki command target resolution, and cross-wiki health coordination have now been removed or assigned. Remaining candidates include command files that still own workflow decisions, remaining platform modules that read config/store state directly, lifecycle/job boundary duplication that remains after the big moves, and large files whose size may still reflect mixed ownership.

## Decision Log

There is now a standalone decision log:

- `decision-log.md` for durable rewrite decisions
- `rewrite-contract.md` for the target architecture and rules
- `worklog.md` for what changed slice by slice

Commit history remains the detailed record for individual landed boundaries.

# Intentional Architecture Rewrite Status

Date: 2026-06-27
Branch: `codex/intentional-architecture-rewrite`

## Current State

The branch has 222 committed rewrite commits past `dev`. The worklog records 174 production slices so far.

The diff is broad: 463 files changed, with 23,090 insertions and 12,383 deletions.

This is no longer a small cleanup branch. It is a real ownership rewrite.

## Done

- Created the rewrite contract and branch-specific worklog.
- Moved CLI process execution and command registration into `src/edges/cli/`.
- Made CLI command files much thinner by moving product workflows into `src/services/`.
- Split wiki workflows into clearer service boundaries: search, show, health, registry, topics, review, reindex, source migration, and doctor wiki checks.
- Moved durable job persistence into explicit stores for records, specs, logs, and worker locks.
- Removed the old top-level `src/jobs/` source bucket; job runtime and projections now live under `src/services/jobs/`, durable job schemas live under `src/stores/jobs/`, and detached worker spawning lives under `src/platform/jobs/`.
- Moved job record lifecycle and display-status read-model helpers out of the job runtime folder, and put public job record/log reads behind the `src/stores/jobs/` store API.
- Removed the mixed `src/services/jobs/runtime/index.ts` compatibility barrel; callers now import concrete runtime, store, platform, or record-lifecycle modules.
- Removed the old top-level `src/init/` source bucket; wiki initialization now lives under `src/services/wiki/`, and mechanical `.almanac/` file scaffolding lives under `src/stores/wiki-files/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/config/` source bucket; persisted config mechanics now live under `src/stores/config/`, service verbs live under `src/services/config/`, and provider enablement policy lives under `src/agent/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/wiki/` source bucket; local wiki index, query, health, topic-file, and source-frontmatter mechanics now live under `src/stores/wiki/`.
- Removed the `src/services/viewer/` service bucket; viewer-only route read models now live under `src/edges/viewer/read-model/`.
- Moved `almanac serve` process lifetime and startup rendering into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving viewer server code as the HTTP/static route owner.
- Moved the hidden internal job worker entrypoint into `src/edges/worker/`; queued job draining remains a job service runtime workflow.
- Moved sync ledger and lock persistence into explicit stores.
- Moved local Claude/Codex transcript discovery, transcript snapshot reads, and timestamp boundary parsing into `src/platform/transcripts/` and removed the old top-level `src/sync/` source bucket.
- Moved lifecycle operation construction and Absorb input/source handling into `src/services/lifecycle/` and removed the old top-level `src/operations/` and `src/absorb/` source buckets.
- Moved GitHub source resolution mechanics into `src/platform/github/`.
- Moved provider execution runtime into `src/agent/runtime/`, especially Claude and Codex app-server mechanics, and made provider runtime environment flow through explicit job/registry contracts.
- Moved setup, diagnostics, update, automation, jobs, sync, lifecycle, config, and agents workflows behind service-owned contracts.
- Moved diagnostic probe result contracts into `src/platform/diagnostics/types.ts`, while `src/services/diagnostics/` now owns only doctor read models and service-facing re-exports.
- Moved setup provider fix-command normalization/execution into `src/services/setup/provider-fix-command.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform shell mechanics.
- Moved setup global-install state/execution into `src/services/setup/global-install.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform package-manager mechanics.
- Split the automation task catalog out of platform launchd mechanics: task meaning/defaults live under `src/services/automation/tasks.ts`, while plist/log paths live under `src/platform/automation/paths.ts`.
- Moved automation scheduler job construction into `src/platform/automation/job-plan.ts`; automation services now keep task/interval policy while platform owns PATH/log/plist job mechanics.
- Split most command rendering into command-private render files.
- Added architecture-boundary tests to stop old dependency leaks from returning.
- Ran repeated lint, focused tests, full test suites, builds, CLI smokes, and review passes across the branch.

## Remaining

- Continue removing ambient runtime state from non-edge layers.
- Continue checking for service files that still know too much about platform, provider, or CLI mechanics.
- Continue checking for command files that still own workflow decisions instead of request shaping and rendering.
- Review large files that remain large because of mixed ownership, not because the domain is naturally dense.
- Continue subsystem-level passes before small leak cleanup.
- Run another broad review pass over the full branch before calling the rewrite merge-ready.

## Latest Checkpoint

The latest slice moved automation scheduler job construction from service planning into `src/platform/automation/job-plan.ts`. Service planning still selects tasks, validates intervals, and chooses command arguments, while platform automation now builds the concrete launchd-shaped job definition.

Verification passed: `npm run lint`, focused automation/boundary tests, full `npm test`, `npm run build`, `node dist/codealmanac.js --version`, `node dist/codealmanac.js automation --help`, and `node dist/codealmanac.js doctor --help`.

## Immediate Next Work

Continue top-down subsystem passes before small leak cleanup. The major loose source buckets for jobs, init, config, wiki, viewer read models, worker entrypoints, serve process lifetime, and automation scheduler job mechanics have now been removed or assigned. Remaining candidates include service files that still know platform/provider mechanics, command files that still own workflow decisions, and any lifecycle/job boundary duplication that remains after the big moves.

## Decision Log

There is now a standalone decision log:

- `decision-log.md` for durable rewrite decisions
- `rewrite-contract.md` for the target architecture and rules
- `worklog.md` for what changed slice by slice

Commit history remains the detailed record for individual landed boundaries.

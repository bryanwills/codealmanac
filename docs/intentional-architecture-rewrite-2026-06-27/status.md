# Intentional Architecture Rewrite Status

Date: 2026-06-27
Branch: `codex/intentional-architecture-rewrite`

## Current State

The branch has more than 230 committed rewrite commits past `dev`. The worklog records 195 production slices so far.

The diff is broad: 492 files changed, with 24,977 insertions and 13,155 deletions.

This is no longer a small cleanup branch. It is a real ownership rewrite.

## Done

- Created the rewrite contract and branch-specific worklog.
- Moved CLI process execution and command registration into `src/edges/cli/`.
- Made CLI command files much thinner by moving product workflows into `src/services/`.
- Split wiki workflows into clearer service boundaries: search, show, health, registry, topics, review, reindex, source migration, and doctor wiki checks.
- Moved durable job persistence into explicit stores for records, specs, logs, and worker locks.
- Removed the old top-level `src/jobs/` source bucket; job runtime and projections now live under `src/services/jobs/`, durable job schemas live under `src/stores/jobs/`, and detached worker spawning lives under `src/platform/jobs/`.
- Moved job record lifecycle and display-status read-model helpers out of the job runtime folder, and put public job record/log reads behind the `src/stores/jobs/` store API.
- Removed raw log-file reads from job projections; stores own job log contents while projections parse contents into viewer/job read models.
- Moved detached job-worker process startup behind an edge-composed background starter; job services now queue records/specs/logs and consume an injected worker starter.
- Moved job page snapshot file reads and page hashing into `src/stores/wiki-files/`.
- Moved registry path reachability checks into `src/stores/wiki-registry/`.
- Removed the mixed `src/services/jobs/runtime/index.ts` compatibility barrel; callers now import concrete runtime, store, platform, or record-lifecycle modules.
- Removed the old top-level `src/init/` source bucket; wiki initialization now lives under `src/services/wiki/`, and mechanical `.almanac/` file scaffolding, page-file counting, and absorb-log scanning live under `src/stores/wiki-files/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/config/` source bucket; persisted config mechanics now live under `src/stores/config/`, service verbs live under `src/services/config/`, and provider enablement policy lives under `src/agent/`.
- Removed the old top-level `src/wiki/` source bucket; local wiki index, query, health, topic-file, and source-frontmatter mechanics now live under `src/stores/wiki/`.
- Moved topic page rewrite scanning and frontmatter read mechanics into `src/stores/wiki/topics/`.
- Removed the `src/services/viewer/` service bucket; viewer-only route read models now live under `src/edges/viewer/read-model/`.
- Moved the interactive setup and uninstall terminal UI out of `src/cli/commands/` and into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving setup services as the product workflow owner.
- Moved `almanac serve` process lifetime and startup rendering into `src/edges/cli/`, leaving viewer server code as the HTTP/static route owner.
- Moved the hidden internal job worker entrypoint into `src/edges/worker/`; queued job draining remains a job service runtime workflow.
- Moved sync ledger and lock persistence into explicit stores.
- Moved local Claude/Codex transcript discovery, transcript snapshot reads, and timestamp boundary parsing into `src/platform/transcripts/` and removed the old top-level `src/sync/` source bucket.
- Moved sync-facing transcript contracts and cursor boundary calculation into `src/shared/transcripts.ts`, leaving platform transcript modules focused on discovery and file reads.
- Moved concrete transcript discovery/snapshot composition behind a service-owned sync transcript runtime contract, with `src/platform/transcripts/runtime.ts` wired by the CLI sync edge.
- Moved lifecycle operation construction and Absorb input/source handling into `src/services/lifecycle/` and removed the old top-level `src/operations/` and `src/absorb/` source buckets.
- Normalized lifecycle operation failures into lifecycle-owned result contracts before command rendering sees them.
- Moved worker-program shape into `src/shared/worker-program.ts` so lifecycle services no longer import platform worker-process mechanics.
- Reshaped update install injection so update services accept typed install results while platform update modules own npm child-process mechanics.
- Moved update state and install-lock persistence into `src/stores/update/`; platform update modules now own registry/npm/version behavior, not JSON state-file mechanics.
- Moved update registry/version/install mechanics behind a service-owned `UpdateRuntime` contract, with the real runtime composed in the CLI edge.
- Moved GitHub source resolution mechanics into `src/platform/github/`.
- Moved Absorb source resolver composition into `src/platform/sources/absorb.ts` and the CLI edge, so lifecycle Absorb services no longer import platform GitHub mechanics.
- Moved provider execution runtime into `src/agent/runtime/`, especially Claude and Codex app-server mechanics, and made provider runtime environment flow through explicit job/registry contracts.
- Moved setup, diagnostics, update, automation, jobs, sync, lifecycle, config, and agents workflows behind service-owned contracts.
- Moved diagnostic probe mechanics into `src/platform/diagnostics/`, while `src/services/diagnostics/` now owns only doctor read models and service-facing re-exports.
- Moved diagnostic fact contracts into `src/shared/diagnostics.ts`, so platform probes and diagnostics services meet through a neutral contract instead of a service-to-platform type import.
- Moved setup provider fix-command normalization/execution into `src/services/setup/provider-fix-command.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform shell mechanics.
- Moved setup global-install state/execution into `src/services/setup/global-install.ts`, so setup TUI files no longer import platform package-manager mechanics.
- Moved setup shell/global-install mechanics behind `src/platform/setup/runtime.ts`, so setup services own contracts/results while the CLI setup edge owns concrete runtime composition.
- Split the automation task catalog out of platform launchd mechanics: task meaning/defaults live under `src/services/automation/tasks.ts`, while plist/log paths live under `src/platform/automation/paths.ts`.
- Moved automation scheduler mechanics behind `src/services/automation/scheduler.ts`, with launchd implementation in `src/platform/automation/scheduler.ts`; automation services no longer import `src/platform/automation/`.
- Moved concrete agent runtime provider registry creation out of job runtime services; CLI and worker edges now inject a `JobAgentRunner`, while `src/agent/runtime/job-runner.ts` owns provider-registry composition.
- Split most command rendering into command-private render files.
- Added architecture-boundary tests to stop old dependency leaks from returning.
- Ran repeated lint, focused tests, full test suites, builds, CLI smokes, and review passes across the branch.

## Remaining

- Continue removing ambient runtime state from non-edge layers.
- Continue checking for service files that still know too much about platform, provider, or CLI mechanics.
- Continue checking for command files that still own workflow decisions instead of request shaping and rendering.
- Review large files that remain large because of mixed ownership, not because the domain is naturally dense.
- Continue subsystem-level passes before small leak cleanup.
- Run another broad review pass over the full branch before calling the rewrite merge-ready.

## Latest Checkpoint

The latest slice moved diagnostic fact contracts out of the platform diagnostics folder. `src/shared/diagnostics.ts` now owns probe result shapes, platform diagnostics modules produce those facts, and `src/services/diagnostics/types.ts` consumes/re-exports the shared contracts for doctor read models.

Verification passed so far: `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` and focused doctor/boundary tests.

## Immediate Next Work

Continue top-down subsystem passes before small leak cleanup. The major loose source buckets for jobs, init, config, wiki, viewer read models, worker entrypoints, serve process lifetime, setup/uninstall terminal UI, wiki file mechanics, automation scheduler mechanics, job provider-runner composition, job-worker process spawning, Absorb source resolver composition, setup runtime composition, sync transcript runtime composition, and diagnostic fact contracts have now been removed or assigned. Remaining candidates include service files that still know provider runtime mechanics, command files that still own workflow decisions, and any lifecycle/job boundary duplication that remains after the big moves.

## Decision Log

There is now a standalone decision log:

- `decision-log.md` for durable rewrite decisions
- `rewrite-contract.md` for the target architecture and rules
- `worklog.md` for what changed slice by slice

Commit history remains the detailed record for individual landed boundaries.

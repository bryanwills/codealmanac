# Lifecycle Architecture

Lifecycle architecture is the cluster that explains how CodeAlmanac performs write-capable wiki work. It spans product workflows, command routing, provider-neutral harness execution, repo-local run records, transcript sync, and scheduled maintenance. [@operations] [@app-composition] [@runs-layer] [@harness] [@automation]

Start with [[wiki-lifecycle-operations]] when the question is "what semantic operation is this?" Start with [[lifecycle-cli]] when the question is "what command did the user run?" Start with [[process-manager-runs]] when the question is "what happened during a lifecycle run?" Start with [[harness-providers]] when the question is "how does this reach Claude, Codex, Cursor, or another runtime?"

## Core Read Order

[[wiki-lifecycle-operations]] is the conceptual overview. Init, ingest, and garden are semantic modes encoded by prompts and workflow code, not generic names for "run an agent."

[[operation-prompts]] explains the base doctrine and operation-specific algorithms that give init, ingest, and garden their judgment rules. Prompt edits are the first place to improve wiki-writing behavior when the missing behavior is editorial judgment rather than deterministic plumbing. [@purpose-prompt] [@notability-prompt] [@init-prompt] [@ingest-prompt] [@garden-prompt]

[[lifecycle-cli]] maps public commands to operations and run behavior. It is the command-surface reference for `init`, `sync`, cloud `runs`, `local runs`, `serve`, `setup`, automation, and the developer ingest/garden surfaces. [@lifecycle-parser] [@cloud-runs-parser]

[[process-manager-runs]] owns repo-local lifecycle run records, background spawn, event logs, cancellation, queue specs, worker locks, attach streaming, reindex-on-success, and run inspection. It is the storage and observability layer for init, ingest, garden, and sync-started ingest execution. It deliberately does not own cloud runs or branch-triggered local runs.

[[harness-providers]] owns the runtime adapter boundary. Workflows create provider-neutral harness requests; adapters translate those requests into Claude, Codex, or future runtimes.

## Operation Pages

[[build-operation]] is historical naming for the first-wiki creation path now surfaced as `codealmanac init`. It matters when work touches onboarding, initial corpus exploration, populated-wiki refusal, or first-run UX.

[[capture-flow]] is the transcript-to-ingest path. It matters when work touches session transcript resolution, capture cost, Codex/Claude transcript stores, or the boundary between raw transcript input and durable project memory.

[[ingest-operation]] is the explicit bounded-source ingest path. It matters when work touches user-supplied files, folders, git ranges, source refs, or other concrete source material that should be distilled into durable wiki memory.

[[capture-automation]] and [[capture-ledger]] explain scheduled quiet-session capture. Read them together when changing sweep eligibility, quiet windows, dedupe, pending reconciliation, or cursor semantics.

[[automation]] explains recurring scheduled tasks such as sync and garden. [[self-update]] is the global package mutation path scheduled automation can invoke, but package mutation remains owned by the update command.

## Boundaries To Preserve

Lifecycle workflows own wiki semantics and construct harness requests. They do not know provider SDKs, prompt transport protocols, launchd details, or run-record file formats.

The runs layer owns repo-local lifecycle execution state and durable observability. It does not decide whether a transcript is worth syncing, whether a page deserves to exist, how provider-specific auth works, or how cloud/local trigger runs are delivered.

Harness providers own runtime execution truth. They must reject unsupported spec fields or report unsupported capabilities rather than silently pretending a provider honored a request.

Automation owns scheduled invocation of known tasks. It does not own transcript eligibility, capture dedupe, Garden judgment, package-update semantics, or run finalization.

Agent readiness, auth checks, global instruction installation, and persisted provider config are support lifecycles, not the same thing as harness execution. [[provider-lifecycle-boundary]] is the current boundary page for that split.

## Historical Context

[[sessionend-hook]] is archived history for hook-based automatic capture. Current automatic sync is scheduler-only and must pass through sync sweep, ledger, and run records.

Deleted bootstrap/build surfaces and the old writer/reviewer capture pipeline are historical names. Current runtime guidance should point to `codealmanac init`, [[wiki-lifecycle-operations]], [[operation-prompts]], and [[process-manager-runs]].

# Harness Providers

The V1 harness layer is Almanac's provider-neutral execution boundary. Operations build one `AgentRunSpec`; provider adapters translate that spec to Claude, Codex, Cursor, or future runtimes and emit normalized `HarnessEvent` records for [[process-manager-runs]].

`[[src/agent/readiness/view.ts]]` is not an execution-provider layer. It builds the setup, `almanac agents`, and doctor projection from config plus provider status/model metadata. The provider-specific readiness code under `[[src/agent/readiness/providers/]]` checks CLI install/auth state and model choices; it does not own runtime execution or runtime capability metadata. Runtime execution and runtime capability metadata belong in `[[src/harness/providers/]]`.

## Provider-neutral contract

`AgentRunSpec` contains provider selection, `cwd`, optional system prompt, assembled prompt, base tool requests, optional helper agent specs, optional skills/MCP config, limits, output schema, and operation metadata. Provider-neutral files must not import Claude, Codex, or Cursor SDK types.

`HarnessEvent` normalizes stream output into text, tool use, tool result, tool summary, context usage, error, and done events. Tool events can carry structured display details such as kind, title, path, command, status, exit code, and duration; `jobs attach` and lifecycle commands run with `--verbose` use those fields to show activity like "Reading file" or "Running command" instead of only provider-specific tool names. Quiet foreground lifecycle runs still log those events to JSONL, but they do not print the live tool stream to stdout. Run summaries preserve provider session id, cost, turns, and usage only when the adapter can actually supply them.

Harness history means CodeAlmanac's own run history: the `AgentRunSpec`, normalized `HarnessEvent` stream, `.almanac/runs/` records, provider session id, usage, cost, status, and failure metadata produced when CodeAlmanac runs an operation. External Claude or Codex JSONL transcript stores are not harness history in this architecture. [[capture-flow]] reads those transcript stores as source material for scheduled Absorb work, but that source discovery should stay outside the harness provider contract unless the provider abstraction is deliberately expanded.

The 2026-05-28 provider-session persistence discussion added one placement rule for future harness work: whether an Almanac maintenance run should create provider-owned session history is lifecycle intent, not a provider-adapter accident. The operation layer expresses this on `AgentRunSpec` as `providerSession.persistence = "ephemeral" | "persistent"`, and each adapter translates that intent to its native mechanism. Claude maps ephemeral maintenance runs to SDK `persistSession: false`, Codex app-server maps them to `thread/start.ephemeral`, and Codex exec maps them to `codex exec --ephemeral`. Hardcoding `--ephemeral` or `persistSession: false` inside one adapter without a spec-level field would hide the product rule and make Build, Absorb, and Garden drift apart.

Provider session persistence is not the same problem as provider process ownership. Non-persistent maintenance sessions keep future sweeps from rediscovering Almanac's own provider-history transcripts; they do not guarantee that killing a CodeAlmanac run kills the provider CLI process and MCP children already spawned for that run. CLI-backed providers now go through the managed child process boundary in `[[src/process/managed-child.ts]]`. Provider adapters ask for a managed child and call `terminate()` or `attachAbort()`; POSIX process groups are the implementation detail behind that boundary rather than a provider-facing concept. Windows provider-process cleanup is intentionally unsupported until it has a tested implementation, so provider adapters should not add their own Windows cleanup branches.

Codex adapters treat provider-process cleanup as a post-run hygiene step, not as the source of the operation result. `[[src/harness/providers/codex/app-server.ts]]` and `[[src/harness/providers/codex/exec.ts]]` catch managed-child termination failures, emit a `HarnessEvent` error such as `Provider process cleanup failed: ...`, and still resolve the harness result that came from the provider protocol. That prevents a cleanup failure from leaving a run unresolved while still preserving the cleanup failure in `.almanac/runs/<run-id>.jsonl`.

The harness layer is also distinct from the agent readiness code under `src/agent/readiness/`. See [[provider-lifecycle-boundary]] for the current boundary: harness providers are the execution adapter layer; readiness, auth, instruction installation, and persisted config are separate agent-support lifecycles.

## Adapters

The Claude adapter maps base tools to Claude Agent SDK tools, passes `tools` and `allowedTools`, sets `permissionMode: "dontAsk"`, supports programmatic per-run subagents, and reports cost/usage when available. Claude-specific auth and capability flags are documented in [[claude-agent-sdk]].

The Codex adapter uses `codex app-server --config mcp_servers={} --listen stdio://` with a three-phase JSON-RPC handshake: `initialize` (sends `clientInfo` and `capabilities: { experimentalApi: true }`), then `thread/start` (sets `approvalPolicy: "never"`, `sandbox: "workspace-write"`, `ephemeral` from `AgentRunSpec.providerSession.persistence`, and `developerInstructions` from the system prompt), then `turn/start` (sends the combined prompt as a single text input item with `sandboxPolicy: { type: "workspaceWrite", networkAccess: <bool> }`). Network access is false for normal maintenance runs and true only when `AgentRunSpec.connectors` declares a connector runtime requirement such as Composio-backed GitHub source ingest. [[src/harness/providers/codex.ts]] is now a provider facade; request construction lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/request.ts]], JSON-RPC process handling lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/app-server.ts]], app-server notification mapping lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/app-notifications.ts]], legacy `codex exec --json` event handling lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/jsonl-events.ts]], and [[src/harness/providers/codex/events.ts]] is only the public compatibility facade for existing imports. Actor/subagent trace state lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/actors.ts]], structured tool display shaping lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/tool-display.ts]], usage parsing lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/usage.ts]], failure classification lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/failures.ts]], loose protocol field decoding lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/fields.ts]], and readiness probing lives in [[src/harness/providers/codex/status.ts]]. The `mcp_servers={}` override prevents user-level Codex MCP config from leaking tools into Almanac runs while preserving normal Codex auth. Two separate timeouts bound each run. Each of the three JSON-RPC handshake requests has a 30-second per-call timeout (default `CODEX_APP_SERVER_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000`; overridable via env var `CODEALMANAC_CODEX_APP_SERVER_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` for testing), guarding against a stalled or incompatible app-server at startup. After `turn/start` resolves successfully, a separate 30-minute watchdog begins (default `CODEX_APP_SERVER_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS = 30 * 60_000`; overridable via `CODEALMANAC_CODEX_APP_SERVER_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` for testing), guarding against a model or agent that accepts the turn but never emits `turn/completed`. The two timeouts address distinct failure modes: startup unresponsiveness versus mid-execution stall. The adapter streams notifications until `turn/completed` and then kills the child process.

App-server notifications map to `HarnessEvent` as follows: `item/agentMessage/delta` → `text_delta`; `item/plan/delta` and `turn/plan/updated` → `tool_summary`; `item/started` and `item/completed` → `tool_use` / `tool_result` with structured display kind (shell, edit, mcp, web, agent, read, write); `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` and `item/fileChange/outputDelta` → `tool_summary`; `thread/tokenUsage/updated` → `context_usage` with usage parsed from `tokenUsage.last` (per-turn counts); `turn/completed` → terminal state; `error` notification → `error` event. The exec-path `parseCodexUsage` reads a flat token shape; the app-server path uses `parseCodexAppServerUsage`, which reads `tokenUsage.last.totalTokens` as the authoritative per-turn total, `tokenUsage.total.totalTokens` for cumulative processed tokens, and `tokenUsage.modelContextWindow` for `maxTokens` (the model's context window size).

The 2026-05-31 responsibility refactor resolved the main Codex adapter cohesion risk without changing the public harness contract. Before that change, `[[src/harness/providers/codex/events.ts]]` owned legacy JSONL event mapping, app-server notification mapping, structured tool display shaping, actor/subagent tracing, usage parsing, and failure classification. It now re-exports the stable import surface while the named Codex-provider modules own their protocol-specific responsibilities.

Server-initiated requests are handled noninteractively so lifecycle commands never block. Known response patterns: `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` and `item/fileChange/requestApproval` → `{ decision: "decline" }`; legacy `execCommandApproval` / `applyPatchApproval` → `{ decision: "denied" }`; `item/tool/requestUserInput` → `{ answers: {} }`; `mcpServer/elicitation/request` → `{ action: "decline", content: null }`; `item/tool/call` → `{ contentItems: [], success: false }`; `item/permissions/requestApproval` → `{ permissions: {}, scope: "turn", strictAutoReview: true }` (empty permission grant); `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` → JSON-RPC error `-32001` (Almanac does not manage ChatGPT auth tokens). Unrecognized server requests return JSON-RPC error `-32601`.

`warning` notifications are non-terminal: the adapter maps them to `tool_summary` events (`Warning: <message>`) so a config or model warning during a turn does not fail the run. `error` notifications read the message from `params.error.message`, `params.error.detail`, or `params.message` and classify the failure via `classifyCodexFailure`.

The adapter supports model override, reasoning effort, structured output schema (passed as `outputSchema` on the turn), and usage reporting. Per-run programmatic subagents, MCP, skills, and max-cost are unsupported and rejected at spec validation time. The older `codex exec --json` helpers remain in [[src/harness/providers/codex/exec.ts]] as compatibility utilities, but the default V1 run path is app-server.

Cursor remains an explicit placeholder provider in V1. It is present in metadata as the future extension point, but runs fail clearly until a real adapter lands.

## Test coverage

The Codex adapter has a unit test suite at `test/codex-harness-provider.test.ts` backed by an in-process fake app-server. The fake server covers command approval, permission requests, explicit ChatGPT token-refresh failure, structured tool display, warning notifications, nested error notifications, token usage, turn completion, silent app-server handshake timeout, and accepted-turn timeout. The fake server is permissive by design: it does not exercise a real Codex turn, configured MCP tool exposure, or future app-server protocol drift. End-to-end coverage requires a real Codex installation.

## Capability rule

Provider metadata describes the adapter implemented here, not the provider ecosystem in general. If an adapter cannot enforce or map a field, it should reject it or mark the capability false instead of pretending the operation layer got the requested behavior.

# AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is Codex's durable instruction file. In this project it matters in two distinct ways: human Codex sessions read it directly, and CodeAlmanac setup manages a small Codex-specific Almanac guide inside the active global file under `~/.codex/`.

## Codex loading rules

The official Codex guide says Codex reads instruction files before doing work. Global scope is `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md` when that file exists and is non-empty; otherwise Codex uses `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Project scope then walks from the project root down to the current working directory and concatenates matching `AGENTS.md` files from broad to specific. Later, more specific files therefore override earlier guidance by position in the combined prompt.

The same guide says empty files are skipped. It also documents a default combined size limit controlled by `project_doc_max_bytes`, with a default of `32 KiB`.

## Repo-local status

The CodeAlmanac repo still has an `AGENTS.md` pattern in `.gitignore`, but the root `AGENTS.md` is now force-tracked as a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`. `git ls-files -s AGENTS.md` records mode `120000`, so Codex and Claude read the same repo-local instruction text without maintaining two tracked copies.

The symlink was introduced after an initial session check incorrectly treated the ignored `AGENTS.md` as an untracked regular file. The durable rule is to verify both the filesystem state and git index mode before making claims about repo-local agent instruction files.

## CodeAlmanac's managed block

[[src/agent/instructions/codex.ts]] encodes the repo's assumption about the active global file. `resolveCodexAgentsPath()` prefers `AGENTS.override.md` only when it exists and `trim()` is non-empty; otherwise it falls back to `AGENTS.md`. That matches the official Codex discovery rule instead of blindly preferring the override filename.

The same file preserves one Codex-specific constraint in code comments and behavior: Codex treats `@file` references inside `AGENTS.md` as plain text rather than expanding them like Claude does in `CLAUDE.md`. `ensureCodexInstructions()` therefore writes the Almanac mini guide inline between `<!-- almanac:start -->` and `<!-- almanac:end -->` instead of trying to import `~/.claude/almanac.md` or another shared file.

## Setup and uninstall behavior

[[src/cli/commands/setup/index.ts]] installs Claude and Codex guidance differently on purpose. Claude gets copied guide files plus an `@~/.claude/almanac.md` import line in `CLAUDE.md`. Codex gets the same mini-guide content inserted directly into the active global AGENTS file. Setup is idempotent because it replaces or appends only the managed block and leaves unrelated user text intact.

[[src/cli/commands/uninstall.ts]] removes the managed block from both `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.override.md` so cleanup does not depend on which file was active when setup last ran. If removing the block leaves either file empty, uninstall deletes that file.

## Role relative to the wiki

[[operation-prompts]] and the wiki are descriptive project memory. `AGENTS.md` is prescriptive agent guidance. The research notes in `docs/research/2026-05-09-codex-harness-capabilities.md` already framed that split: stable repo conventions belong in Codex instruction files, while Build/Absorb/Garden assemble their own operation prompts and should not use `AGENTS.md` as the carrier for transcript-specific or per-run goals.

The project-level review rule against [[accidental-special-case-architecture]] belongs in prescriptive agent guidance and `.claude/agents/review.md`, not in Build/Absorb/Garden prompts. It constrains how agents judge implementation shape, while operation prompts constrain how agents write wiki memory.

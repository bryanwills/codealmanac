# Almanac Wiki

This is the Almanac wiki for the codealmanac repo itself — the CLI and agent harness that produces and queries `.almanac/` wikis. It preserves the project understanding that code alone cannot carry: design decisions, subsystem contracts, agent prompt behavior, external runtime assumptions, product semantics, constraints, and failure modes found in real runs.

The primary reader is an AI coding agent picking up a new session. Write accordingly: dense, factual, linked.

## Notability bar

Write a page when there is **non-obvious knowledge that will help a future agent**. Specifically:

- A decision that took discussion, research, or trial-and-error (e.g. GLOB vs LIKE for path queries)
- A failure mode discovered through a real run (e.g. FTS5 ON DELETE CASCADE doesn't fire)
- A cross-cutting flow that spans multiple files (e.g. capture resolving a transcript, starting Absorb, and recording a run)
- A constraint or invariant not visible from the code (e.g. registry entries are never auto-dropped)
- A subsystem or third-party integration referenced by multiple pages
- A product or market conclusion that changes how Almanac should be built, positioned, priced, or trusted
- A distilled external reference whose APIs, limits, or conventions shape this repo's current design

Do not write pages that restate what the code does. Do not write pages of inference. Silence is acceptable. Build, Absorb, and Garden enforce this bar through prompts, not through a TypeScript review pipeline. The wiki can cover material outside this repo when that material has become durable CodeAlmanac project memory; it should not become a generic reference library.

## Topic taxonomy

Topics form a DAG serialized in `.almanac/topics.yaml`. A page can belong to multiple topics.

| Topic | What belongs here |
|-------|------------------|
| `stack` | Third-party libraries and services we depend on |
| `systems` | Custom subsystems built in this repo (indexer, registry, DAG, viewer) |
| `flows` | Multi-step processes spanning files (capture, build, jobs) |
| `decisions` | Architectural choices — "why X over Y" |
| `agents` | AI agent integration: harness providers, operation prompts, Build/Absorb/Garden (child of `flows` + `stack`) |
| `cli` | CLI command surface and wiring (child of `systems`) |
| `automation` | Scheduled background behavior and its command surface (child of `flows` + `cli`) |
| `storage` | SQLite index and registry persistence (child of `systems`) |
| `wiki-design` | Product and architecture decisions about what a codebase wiki should contain and how pages, hubs, topics, and links should fit together (child of `systems` + `decisions`) |
| `product-positioning` | Product, market, user, pricing, and positioning synthesis that shapes how CodeAlmanac is explained and sold |
| `fundraising` | Investor-facing narrative, pitch deck, and financing assumptions (child of `product-positioning`) |
| `provider-harness` | Runtime provider adapters, readiness boundaries, auth assumptions, and provider-neutral run contracts (child of `agents` + `systems`) |
| `prompt-system` | Operation prompts, base prompt modules, and external writing systems that shape wiki-writing behavior (child of `agents` + `wiki-design`) |
| `competitive-research` | Adjacent memory, knowledge-base, and company-brain products that shape CodeAlmanac positioning (child of `product-positioning`) |

Add domain topics as the wiki grows. New topics go in `topics.yaml`; `almanac topics create` handles this.

## Page shapes

Common shapes cover most pages here. They are suggestions, not a schema.

- **Entity** — a stable named thing: Claude Agent SDK, the SQLite indexer, the global registry
- **Decision** — "why we chose X" — includes the rejected alternatives and their cost
- **Flow** — a multi-file process: build operation, capture flow, process manager run lifecycle
- **Constraint** — a rule, invariant, or coupling future work must preserve
- **Failure Mode** — a specific way behavior breaks, usually discovered through a real run or test

Major entities, subsystems, and external dependencies may need a subject neighborhood rather than a single page. The anchor page names the subject and routes readers; supporting pages cover behavior, structure, contracts, rationale, constraints, failure modes, workflows, or sources when those subtopics have independent value.

## Writing conventions

- Every sentence contains a specific fact. If it doesn't, cut it.
- Neutral tone. "is", not "serves as". No vague attribution, no hedging.
- Prose first. Bullets for genuine lists. Tables only for structured comparison.
- No formulaic conclusions. End with the last substantive fact.
- Reference env vars by name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, not "the API key". Reference config paths exactly: `~/.almanac/registry.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- No speculative content ("chosen for scalability" when we don't know why).

## Linking

One double-bracket syntax, disambiguated by content:

- `[[capture-flow]]` — page slug (no slash)
- `[[src/indexer/schema.ts]]` — file reference (has slash)
- `[[src/indexer/]]` — folder reference (trailing slash)
- `[[other-wiki:slug]]` — cross-wiki reference (colon before slash)

Every entity page should be linked from the pages that depend on it. A page with no links in or out is suspect.

## Pages live in `.almanac/pages/`

One markdown file per page, kebab-case slug. Frontmatter carries `title:`, `topics:`, and `sources:` entries with stable IDs, types, targets, and notes. Use `sources[type=file]` for repo files that should power file-aware retrieval; legacy `files:` is still read for older pages during migration.

The flat layout is intentional. Topics are a multi-parent DAG — a single page can belong to `flows`, `decisions`, `storage`, and `cli` simultaneously. Nesting pages under topic folders would either lose those relationships or require duplication.

## Human browsing

`almanac serve` starts a local read-only viewer at `http://localhost:3927`. It is the primary way for humans to read the wiki: rendered markdown, clickable wikilinks, FTS search, topic browser, and backlinks panel per page. See [[almanac-serve]] for architecture and design details.

The filesystem (`.almanac/pages/`) is the source of truth and the editing surface. The viewer is disposable — kill it, restart it, get the same wiki.

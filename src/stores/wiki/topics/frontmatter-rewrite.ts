/**
 * Rewrite the `topics:` field in a markdown file's YAML frontmatter.
 *
 * The absolute requirement is **body byte-preservation**. Tag/untag/
 * rename commands touch only the frontmatter; everything after the
 * closing `---` must be byte-identical to the input (same line endings,
 * same trailing whitespace, same final-newline-or-not). We lean on a
 * precise split rather than re-serializing the whole file so any
 * incidental bytes in the body (literal `\r\n`, unusual trailing
 * whitespace, triple-hyphen rulers) are left alone.
 *
 * For the frontmatter itself we do a **surgical rewrite of the `topics:`
 * field only** — not a full YAML roundtrip. Reasons:
 *   - `js-yaml` normalizes quoting, re-orders keys alphabetically by
 *     default, and can drop comments. Any of those would surprise a user
 *     who hand-edited their own frontmatter and expects their formatting
 *     preserved byte-for-byte.
 *   - We only care about one field. Replacing just that field lets the
 *     rest of the YAML survive verbatim.
 *
 * The strategy:
 *   1. Find the exact span of the `topics:` key (whether flow
 *      `topics: [a, b]` or block `topics:\n  - a\n  - b\n`) using a
 *      small line scanner.
 *   2. Compute the new topics list from the caller's transform.
 *   3. Replace the span with a freshly-emitted `topics: [a, b, c]` line
 *      (flow style — compact, readable, and what most authors write).
 *   4. If no `topics:` key exists and the new list is non-empty, append
 *      a line to the end of the frontmatter block.
 *   5. If `topics:` exists but the new list is empty, drop the line
 *      entirely rather than leaving `topics: []` around.
 *
 * The transform function gets the current deduplicated topic list and
 * returns the new list. Returning an empty array means "remove the
 * `topics:` key entirely".

def starter_readme() -> str:
    return """# CodeAlmanac Wiki

This is the living wiki for this repository. It records the durable knowledge
the code cannot say: decisions, flows, invariants, incidents, gotchas, and
project context that future agents should not rediscover from scratch.

## Notability Bar

Write a page when it preserves non-obvious knowledge that will help a future
agent work safely in this codebase.

Good pages explain:

- a decision that took research or trial-and-error
- a cross-file flow
- an invariant or gotcha not visible from one file
- an external dependency as this repo uses it
- a product or operational constraint that shapes future work

Do not write pages that restate nearby code.

## Topic Taxonomy

Topics live in `topics.yaml`. Pages live in `pages/`.

## Links

Use `[[page-slug]]` for page links and `[[src/path.py]]` for file references.

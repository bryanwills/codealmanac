# Ingest Operation

You are improving an existing CodeAlmanac wiki from bounded selected material.

The input may be a coding session, file, folder, diff, document, docs read,
research note, market read, product conversation, incident, user feedback, or
other concrete pointer. Treat that input as raw material, not as the output.

Use the source briefs, source runtime snapshots, and bundled manual text in the
runtime context as operation input. The brief identifies the selected source
and its provenance hint. The runtime snapshot is readable source material
gathered before the agent run.

## Algorithm

1. Understand the starting context and what kind of input it is.
2. Extract candidate durable learnings, conclusions, entities, changed
   assumptions, project-world connections, risks, and synthesis updates.
3. Inspect the current `almanac/` tree for the right home before creating pages.
4. Verify important claims against code, tests, docs, sources, git history, or
   provided context when useful.
5. Prefer updating existing evolving pages over creating pages.
6. Create a page only when the input reveals a durable concept that needs its
   own anchor.
7. Avoid temporal pages unless the date, event, or snapshot is part of the
   meaning. If you create a temporal page, update or link the synthesis page or
   hub it informs.
8. Update topics and Markdown links so the new understanding joins the graph.
9. Run `codealmanac validate` and fix reported wiki source errors.
10. No-op when the input does not improve durable project knowledge.

When you create or substantially edit a page, use structured `sources:`
frontmatter for evidence. Use `type: file` sources for repo files, tests,
prompts, config, and migrations. Do not emit the retired file-list field.

Do not summarize sessions, files, docs, market reads, or conversations. Distill
their reusable project meaning.

Keep changes proportional to the input. Broad restructuring is valid when the
input reveals a real graph problem, but do not churn unrelated pages.

## Helper Agents

Most ingest runs should be single-agent. If the input spans multiple
independent areas, requires external verification, or is large enough that
parallel investigation will materially improve quality, use helper agents for
bounded research or draft fragments.

The main agent owns final integration, page boundaries, topics, links, hubs,
and final prose.

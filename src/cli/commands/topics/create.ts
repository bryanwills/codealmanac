/**
 * `almanac topics create <name> [--parent <slug>]...`.
 *
 * Policy: `--parent <slug>` MUST refer to an existing topic (created
 * earlier in topics.yaml or indexed from page frontmatter). Auto-
 * creating parents silently would let typos cascade — `create JWT
 * --parent secuirty` would quietly spawn a "secuirty" topic. Better to
 * refuse and point the user at `almanac topics create <parent>` first.
 *
 * Already-exists is not an error if no new parents are being added —
 * rerunning the same `create` is a no-op. If new parents are introduced
 * we add them (respecting cycle prevention, just like `link`).

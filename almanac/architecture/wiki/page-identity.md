# Page Identity

Page identity is the route a Markdown page gets from its path under `almanac/`. The route is not stored in frontmatter: `almanac/architecture/indexing.md` becomes `architecture/indexing`, and a folder `README.md` becomes the route for that folder [@wiki-paths] [@concepts-doc]. This makes the committed tree itself the page namespace.

The identity rule matters because the index, search results, page links, and route-collision checks all use the same slug. A page can change its title without changing its identity, but moving or renaming the Markdown file changes the route that other pages link to [@wiki-documents] [@index-sources].

## Path To Slug

`page_id_for_path(...)` requires a Markdown file relative to the repository's `almanac/` directory [@wiki-paths]. For ordinary pages, it removes the `.md` suffix and returns the POSIX-style relative path. For the root `README.md`, it returns `README`; for a nested `README.md`, it returns the folder path [@wiki-paths].

That gives these route shapes:

| File | Page slug |
|---|---|
| `almanac/README.md` | `README` |
| `almanac/architecture/README.md` | `architecture` |
| `almanac/architecture/wiki/page-identity.md` | `architecture/wiki/page-identity` |

When a page is loaded, `load_page_document(...)` uses that slug, keeps the Markdown file path, records the relative path, hashes the full raw file, and stores the filesystem mtime as `updated_at` [@wiki-documents]. The title comes from frontmatter, then the first H1, then the filename stem [@wiki-documents].

## Reserved Source Folders

The page iterator walks `almanac/**/*.md`, but it skips Markdown files beneath reserved wiki source directories [@wiki-paths]. The current reserved directories are `manual` and `jobs` [@wiki-paths]. This lets the wiki tree contain operational or manual material without turning every Markdown file in those internal areas into a public page route.

Reserved filtering happens before document loading, so skipped files do not receive slugs, links, topics, or file references in the derived index [@wiki-paths] [@index-sources].

## Route Collisions

Because `README.md` maps to its folder route, two different files can try to claim the same slug. For example, `almanac/architecture.md` and `almanac/architecture/README.md` both map to `architecture` [@concepts-doc]. `load_documents(...)` tracks seen slugs and raises a validation failure when two files map to the same page route [@index-sources].

This check protects links and search results from ambiguity. A page slug should identify one Markdown source file, not whichever file happened to be indexed first.

## Links Use Page Identity

CodeAlmanac uses normal Markdown links for page links. The link parser ignores external URLs, anchors, absolute paths, query strings, backslash paths, paths with spaces, and hrefs that look like files with suffixes [@wiki-links]. It resolves relative links against the source page's route, with special handling for folder landing pages [@wiki-links].

The parser tests show the intended behavior: from `architecture/indexing`, `wiki-tree` resolves to `architecture/wiki-tree`, `../decisions/local-first-python` resolves to `decisions/local-first-python`, and file-looking links such as `src/auth.py` are ignored as page links [@wiki-parsing-tests]. For the exact page-link rules, see [Links and routes](../../reference/page-format/links-and-routes).

## What Future Changes Must Preserve

The page namespace is path-based. Frontmatter may describe a page, cite evidence, and assign topics, but it does not own the route [@wiki-documents]. Future work on search, validation, or viewers should continue to treat nested Markdown path identity as the shared contract between the repo tree and the derived index.

The surrounding concept is [Local repo wiki](../../concepts/local-repo-wiki). Search and display behavior built on these slugs is covered in [Index refresh and search](index-refresh-and-search).

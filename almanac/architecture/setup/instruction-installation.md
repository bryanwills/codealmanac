# Instruction Installation

Instruction installation is how `setup` gives a coding agent (Claude or Codex)
standing knowledge that CodeAlmanac exists and how to use it, before that
agent ever opens a specific repository. `SetupService.run` calls
`FileInstructionInstaller.install` for the selected `SetupTarget` values
unless instructions are skipped [@setup-service] [@instructions]. This is
separate from the per-repository wiki under `almanac/`: instruction
installation writes to the user's home directory, not to any repository.

## The Installed Guide

Both targets install the same guide text. `read_agent_guide` loads
`src/codealmanac/services/setup/agent-guide.md` as packaged data through
`importlib.resources`, so the guide ships with the installed CLI rather than
depending on a source checkout layout [@guide-reader] [@guide-content]. The
guide has two halves that correspond to a coding agent's two different modes
of contact with CodeAlmanac.

The first half orients the agent to the wiki as an ordinary knowledge source
during coding work: when to consult CodeAlmanac (unfamiliar subsystems,
architectural decisions, cross-cutting behavior) versus when it is
unnecessary (typos, mechanical edits), how the `almanac/` tree, page identity,
and `topics.yaml` fit together, then concrete `codealmanac search` (text,
`--mentions`, `--topic`) and `codealmanac show PAGE` (`--lead`, `--body`,
`--links`, `--backlinks`, `--files`, `--topics`) usage matching the public CLI
surface [@guide-content] [@command-surface]. It also covers `codealmanac
topics` and `topics show TOPIC` for browsing a wiki area by subject,
`codealmanac list` for reading across multiple registered repositories, and
`codealmanac health` and `codealmanac validate` for checking whether the wiki
itself looks wrong [@guide-content]. It states an explicit trust order for a
contradiction: current code outranks the Almanac, and the Almanac outranks
ordinary repository documentation [@guide-content].

The second half is a boundary statement: during ordinary coding work the
agent should treat the wiki as read-only, searching and reading it but not
editing pages, sources, links, topics, or structure. Wiki maintenance belongs
to CodeAlmanac's own Init, Ingest, Garden, and Sync workflows, which carry
their own manuals for deciding what deserves documentation [@guide-content].
This keeps a general-purpose coding agent from improvising wiki edits outside
the lifecycle operations described in [Lifecycle workflows](../lifecycle/workflows)
and [Agents and manuals](../runtime-resources/prompts-and-manuals), which
package stable Yoke agent instructions and expose the manuals those operations use.

## Per-Target Mechanics

Claude and Codex are installed differently because their global instruction
files have different conventions.

For Claude, the installer writes the guide verbatim to a dedicated file,
`~/.claude/codealmanac.md`, and ensures `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` contains a
single import line, `@~/.claude/codealmanac.md` [@claude-installer]. Uninstall
deletes the guide file and strips the import line, collapsing any blank lines
left behind; if `CLAUDE.md` becomes empty it is removed entirely
[@claude-installer].

For Codex, the installer upserts the guide directly into the agent's AGENTS
file, wrapped in `<!-- codealmanac:start -->` / `<!-- codealmanac:end -->`
markers so a re-run replaces exactly that block instead of duplicating it or
disturbing surrounding content [@codex-installer] [@managed-blocks]. The
target file is `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md` when that file already has
non-empty content, otherwise `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` [@codex-installer].
Uninstall removes the managed block from both possible paths and deletes a
file that becomes empty [@codex-installer].

Both installers report an `InstructionChange` naming the `SetupTarget`,
whether anything changed, which paths were touched, and a human-readable
message, so `setup`'s JSON and interactive output can say "already installed"
without rewriting untouched files [@setup-models] [@claude-installer]
[@codex-installer]. This mirrors the idempotence expectations described in
[Setup automation and update](automation-and-update).

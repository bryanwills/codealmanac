# Service Boundaries

CodeAlmanac uses service boundaries to keep product behavior out of adapters and provider code. The intended dependency direction is `cli -> app -> workflows -> services -> stores/ports -> integrations`, with `src/codealmanac/app.py` as the place where those layers are assembled [@cosmic-translation] [@app-root]. This means a command, server wrapper, worker, or test should call a service or workflow through a typed request, while provider-specific code stays behind a port.

The boundary matters because this repository is a local product with many edges: terminal commands, local SQLite state, Git probes, scheduled automation, source runtimes, and agent harnesses. The code shape keeps those edges from becoming the core. Tests make that rule executable by failing if `cli`, `workflows`, or `services` import `integrations` directly [@architecture-tests].

## Dependency Rule

The repo's local Cosmic Python note translates the book into a CodeAlmanac-specific rule: services own product verbs, stores own persistence, ports live near the service that owns the contract, and integrations implement those ports [@cosmic-translation]. The application object returned by `create_app` exposes services such as `repositories`, `search`, `health`, `runs`, `sources`, and `harnesses`, plus lifecycle workflows under `workflows` [@app-root].

This is not a generic layering diagram. In CodeAlmanac, `SearchService` is the product verb for searching pages, `RunsService` owns run records and events, `SourcesService` owns source resolution, and `HarnessesService` owns the agent-run provider contract. Their collaborators are injected from the [Composition Root](composition-root), so the services do not need to know whether the harness is Codex, Claude, or a fake in a test [@app-root].

## Workflows Above Services

Workflows coordinate product operations that cross service boundaries. Build, ingest, garden, queued runs, and sync are assembled together as `CodeAlmanacWorkflows` [@app-root]. For example, ingest needs sources, runs, operation execution, prompts, and manuals; it is therefore a workflow rather than a single service call.

The boundary is that workflows may orchestrate services, but they still should not reach into integrations. The architecture tests enforce this by including `workflows` in the same "must not import integrations" rule as the CLI and services [@architecture-tests]. That keeps lifecycle orchestration provider-neutral.

## Stores And Ports

Persistence and outside systems sit below services, but they are different kinds of dependencies. Stores such as `RepositoryStore`, `IndexStore`, `RunStore`, `ConfigStore`, and `SyncStateStore` are constructed in the composition root and handed to the service that owns the data [@app-root]. Ports such as `HarnessAdapter`, `SourceRuntimeAdapter`, `TranscriptDiscoveryAdapter`, `SchedulerAdapter`, and `RunWorkerSpawner` describe outside capabilities in service-owned terms [@app-root].

Integrations implement those ports. The composition root chooses defaults such as `LaunchdSchedulerAdapter`, `GitRepositoryChangeProbe`, `SubprocessRunWorkerSpawner`, default harness adapters, and default source runtime adapters [@app-root]. This preserves a clear rule: the core asks for a capability, and the integration decides how to talk to the outside world.

## Enforced Shape

Several tests protect the boundary as architecture, not style. `test_cli_workflows_and_services_do_not_import_integrations` blocks imports that would reverse the dependency rule. `test_database_package_owns_sqlite_imports` keeps raw SQLite use inside the database package. Other architecture tests keep CLI render, dispatch, index views, and setup responsibilities split by owner [@architecture-tests].

The result is a codebase where a new feature should first find its owner. If it is a user verb, it usually belongs in a service or workflow. If it speaks to Git, launchd, a provider SDK, subprocesses, or local files outside the product model, it usually belongs behind a port implemented under `integrations`. When a command crosses into the system, [Request Models](request-models) carry the shaped input instead of passing raw adapter state inward.

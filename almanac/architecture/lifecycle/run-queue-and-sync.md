# Run Queue And Sync

The run queue stores build, ingest, and garden work as durable run records with specs, then starts a local worker to drain queued work [@run_queue] [@run_models]. Sync is a scanner that can enqueue ingest work; it is not itself a page-writing lifecycle operation [@sync_workflow].

This page connects the [Run Ledger](../../concepts/run-ledger) concept to lifecycle execution. The exact states and event shapes are in [Run States And Events](../../reference/runs/run-states-and-events).

## Queueing

`RunQueue.queue_build(...)` prepares the target repository, rejects an existing `almanac/`, registers the repository, scaffolds the minimal wiki, builds a durable build spec, and queues the run [@run_queue]. `start_build(...)` then spawns a worker from the requested repository path [@run_queue].

`RunQueue.queue_ingest(...)` and `queue_garden(...)` select an existing target repository, build a durable run spec, and call the run service to queue the work [@run_queue]. `start_ingest(...)` and `start_garden(...)` queue the work and then spawn a worker process [@run_queue].

Scheduled Garden iterates registered repositories and skips repositories that already have an active garden run [@run_queue]. When at least one run is queued, it spawns one worker from the first queued repository root [@run_queue].

## Worker Drain

`RunQueueWorker.drain(...)` acquires a worker lock through the run service before it drains queued records [@run_worker]. If the lock is unavailable, the drain result reports `lock_acquired=False` [@run_worker] [@run_models].

For each queued run, the worker starts a hidden `__run-executor <run-id>` child and waits for it. `RunExecutor` atomically claims the row with its execution identity, reads the durable spec, and calls `BuildWorkflow.execute_started(...)`, `IngestWorkflow.execute_started(...)`, or `GardenWorkflow.execute_started(...)` [@run_worker] [@run_executor]. The worker reconciles the terminal record before selecting the next row, so cancelling one executor does not kill queue management or strand later work [@run_worker].

Running cancellation goes through `RunCancellation`: record intent, terminate the verified executor and its descendant harness processes, confirm exit, then append the terminal `cancelled` status. The process adapter validates PID birth time before signaling and escalates from graceful termination to force kill when necessary [@run_processes].

## Atomic Idle Handoff

Every lifecycle start queues its run and spawns a worker. A spawned worker exits with `lock_acquired=False` when another worker already owns the global drain lock; the owner is responsible for picking up later queued work [@run_queue] [@run_worker].

When the owner observes an empty queue, it calls `release_worker_if_idle(...)`. The worker-lock store starts an immediate SQLite transaction, verifies ownership, repeats the canonical oldest-queued-run query, and deletes the lock only if the queue remains empty [@run_worker] [@worker_locks]. Queue insertion uses the same write-transaction boundary. If insertion commits first, the current worker retains the lock and continues; if idle release commits first, the producer's newly spawned worker can acquire the free lock. This closes the empty-check-to-release lost-wakeup window without polling or a permanent daemon.

## Sync Boundary

Sync discovers local transcript candidates and queues ordinary ingest runs through this queue boundary [@sync_workflow]. That keeps transcript discovery separate from authorship: sync decides what should be ingested, while ingest remains the operation that writes pages.

Future worktree support should keep that boundary. Sync may need to ask repositories which registered wiki owns a transcript working directory, but the affiliation decision belongs in the repository service rather than in sync-specific provider or workspace checks [@affiliation-decision]. See [Repository Affiliation Belongs In Repository Service](../../decisions/repository-affiliation-belongs-in-repository-service).

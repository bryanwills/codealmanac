# Run Queue And Sync

The run queue stores build, ingest, and garden work as durable run records with specs, then starts a local worker to drain queued work [@run_queue] [@run_models]. Sync is a scanner that can enqueue ingest work; it is not itself a page-writing lifecycle operation [@sync_workflow].

This page connects the [Run Ledger](../../concepts/run-ledger) concept to lifecycle execution. The exact states and event shapes are in [Run States And Events](../../reference/runs/run-states-and-events).

## Queueing

`RunQueue.queue_build(...)` prepares the target repository, rejects an existing `almanac/`, registers the repository, scaffolds the minimal wiki, builds a durable build spec, and queues the run [@run_queue]. `start_build(...)` then spawns a worker from the requested repository path [@run_queue].

`RunQueue.queue_ingest(...)` and `queue_garden(...)` select an existing target repository, build a durable run spec, and call the run service to queue the work [@run_queue]. `start_ingest(...)` and `start_garden(...)` queue the work and then spawn a worker process [@run_queue].

Scheduled Garden iterates registered repositories and skips repositories that already have an active garden run [@run_queue]. When at least one run is queued, it spawns one worker from the first queued repository root [@run_queue].

## Worker Drain

`RunQueueWorker.drain(...)` acquires a worker lock through the run service before it drains queued records [@run_worker]. If the lock is unavailable, the drain result reports `lock_acquired=False` [@run_worker] [@run_models].

For each queued run, the worker starts a hidden `__run-executor <run-id>` child and waits for it. `RunExecutor` atomically claims the row with its execution identity, reads the durable spec, and calls `BuildWorkflow.execute_started(...)`, `IngestWorkflow.execute_started(...)`, or `GardenWorkflow.execute_started(...)` [@run_worker] [@run_executor]. The worker reconciles the terminal record before selecting the next row, so cancelling one executor does not kill queue management or strand later work [@run_worker].

Running cancellation goes through `RunCancellation`: record intent, terminate the verified executor and its descendant harness processes, confirm exit, then append the terminal `cancelled` status. The process adapter validates PID birth time before signaling and escalates from graceful termination to force kill when necessary [@run_processes].

## Sync Boundary

Sync discovers local transcript candidates and queues ordinary ingest runs through this queue boundary [@sync_workflow]. That keeps transcript discovery separate from authorship: sync decides what should be ingested, while ingest remains the operation that writes pages.

# Operation Runner

`OperationRunner` is the shared execution path for page-writing lifecycle operations. Build, ingest, and garden prepare their own context and prompt, then delegate the common run mechanics to this service [@operation-service]. The runner owns the sequence from running-state transition through harness execution, transcript and event recording, harness success validation, index refresh, final wiki validation, and terminal run state.

This shape exists so lifecycle workflows do not reimplement harness and run plumbing. The architecture tests keep shared operation execution in the operation package and reject copied fragments such as `RunHarnessRequest`, run finishing requests, and harness event helpers inside ingest and garden services [@architecture-tests].

## Context

`begin` marks the run running and resolves the repository for that run [@operation-service]. The returned `OperationContext` carries the run id and repository [@operation-models].

`OperationContext` is intentionally small. It carries the run id and selected repository, which are the only shared facts the runner needs for recording events, invoking the harness, refreshing the index, validating the wiki, and finishing the run [@operation-models] [@operation-service].

## Harness Execution

`execute` builds a `RunHarnessRequest` containing the harness kind, model, repository root, rendered prompt, and optional title. It then calls `HarnessesService.ensure_ready` before the separate `run_ready` provider invocation [@operation-service]. The runner records the harness transcript if one exists and converts normalized harness events into run log events [@operation-service].

Event classification lives beside the runner, not in individual workflows. `text_delta` events are dropped before classification and never become a run event, so incremental streaming text does not bloat the durable run log. Of the remaining events, harness error events become run error events; tool use, tool result, tool summary, usage, provider session, warning, and helper-agent events become tool events; and every other harness event becomes an output event [@operation-harness].

If a harness returns no event stream, the harness helper creates a terminal fallback event from the harness status and output text [@operation-harness]. That keeps failed and minimal harness adapters visible in the run log.

## Safety And Completion

After recording harness output, the runner validates harness success [@operation-service] [@operation-harness]. A failed harness therefore leaves its transcript and output in the run log before the run is marked failed.

The runner then refreshes the index, validates the wiki through `HealthService.ensure_valid`, and finishes the run as `DONE` with the harness summary or operation success summary [@operation-service]. Each step runs inside an explicit failure phase. A failed readiness check becomes `harness_readiness`; an adapter exception or normalized failed result becomes `provider_execution`; index refresh becomes `indexing`; final health validation becomes `wiki_validation`; and event-sink or run machinery failures become `internal_error` [@operation-service]. `fail` computes a non-throwing one-line summary, then best-efforts the readable error event and authoritative terminal transition independently. It records the supplied phase rather than inferring durable analytics from exception classes or traceback modules.

The readiness and invocation calls are the stage distinction: missing, unavailable, or failed readiness checks are `harness_readiness`; once readiness passes, adapter exceptions are `provider_execution` regardless of their exception class. `HarnessEventSinkFailed` preserves the one exception to that stage rule by identifying caller-owned event persistence as `internal_error` [@operation-service]. Ingest source resolution and runtime inspection occur before shared execution, so the ingest workflow marks those scopes as `source_preparation` while still delegating the actual failure write to `OperationRunner`.

## Architectural Boundary

The architecture tests enforce this ownership. They require operation service, harness, and commit modules to exist; require `workflows/operations/mutation.py` to be absent; and reject fragments such as `RunHarnessRequest`, `FinishRunRequest`, and harness event helpers inside ingest and garden workflow services [@architecture-tests]. Workflow services may name their preparation phase through `OperationRunner.failure_phase`; they still do not write run failures themselves.

That guardrail matters for future changes. New page-writing operation kinds should call the runner with their own prompt and context. They should not copy the lifecycle machinery that already lives here.

## Related Safety Page

The write boundary for lifecycle agents is covered in [Mutation safety](mutation-safety). That page explains the current split between prompt-level source-control policy and runtime wiki validation.

When a run fails at one of these steps, [Debug a failed lifecycle run](../../guides/debug-a-failed-lifecycle-run) walks through distinguishing a harness failure from a wiki validation failure using the recorded event stream.

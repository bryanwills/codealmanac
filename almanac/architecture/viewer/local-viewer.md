# Local Viewer

The local viewer is the read-only browser surface exposed by `codealmanac serve`. It projects repo wiki pages, topics, file evidence, registered wiki navigation, and lifecycle jobs from local state; it does not own a separate store or write path [@readme] [@viewer_service].

The command accepts `--wiki`, `--host`, and `--port`, with parser defaults of `127.0.0.1:3927` when host and port are omitted [@parser]. Pages, links, topics, source references, and file references come from the index read model. Job lists and job detail come from the run ledger. The browser routes between those projections with hash routes and renders the current repository's wiki graph [@viewer_service] [@viewer_js].

## Entry Point

The serve dispatch imports `uvicorn` and the FastAPI server lazily, builds the server with the current working directory and optional wiki name, prints the viewer URL, and runs the server with warning-level logs [@dispatch]. `create_server_app` is the server composition root: it registers error handlers, API routes, and static routes without defining endpoint logic itself [@server_app].

The API layer maps HTTP routes to `ViewerService` request objects. `/api/overview`, `/api/page/{slug}`, `/api/search`, `/api/file`, `/api/topic/{slug}`, `/api/jobs`, and `/api/jobs/{run_id}` all call the viewer service through the application object [@server_api]. When `codealmanac serve --wiki <name>` scopes the server, the API uses that repository name instead of per-request `wiki` parameters [@server_api].

## Service Shape

`ViewerService` is constructed with `RepositoriesService`, `IndexService`, `RunsService`, and `MarkdownRenderer` [@viewer_service]. Repository selection is handled through `ViewerRepositoryScope`, so every viewer request resolves the active repository before reading pages, topics, files, or jobs [@viewer_service] [@scope].

The default selection uses normal repository read selection for the current working directory, then falls back to the first available registered repository if no cwd match exists [@scope]. Viewer navigation includes only repositories whose state is `AVAILABLE`; a scoped server returns only the selected repository in its navigation list [@scope] [@server_api].

The main entrypoints are `overview`, `page`, `search`, `file`, `topic`, `jobs`, and `job` [@viewer_service]. `overview` returns repository navigation, page and topic counts, a limited page list, a full navigation page list, topics, and a featured README page when present [@viewer_service]. `search` delegates to index search. `topic` normalizes the topic slug, reads the topic with optional descendants, and raises `NotFoundError` if the topic does not exist [@viewer_service].

## Page Projection

Page detail combines index data with rendered Markdown. `page` loads the `PageView`, renders the body, and returns title, summary, topics, raw body, HTML, backlinks, outgoing links, file references, sources, and related pages [@viewer_service]. Related pages are derived from incoming and outgoing page links, with duplicates and self-links removed [@viewer_service].

The projection module keeps conversion rules small and explicit. It maps repositories, topics, sources, and page summaries into viewer models [@projections]. Source display order follows citation order when the renderer reports citations; uncited sources sort after cited sources by source id [@projections]. File paths are shown relative to the repository's `almanac/` path when possible, with the old `pages/` prefix stripped if it appears in indexed data [@projections].

Tests make the reader contract concrete. The viewer renders Markdown links as viewer routes, escapes script tags, exposes code-formatted file references, reports backlinks, lists pages that mention file and folder references, and rejects file requests outside repo-relative reference space [@viewer_tests].

## Jobs And Runs

The viewer exposes lifecycle jobs through run service reads. `jobs` lists recent runs for the selected repository, and `job` attaches to a run snapshot to return the run plus normalized events [@viewer_service]. Tests verify that job detail includes run kind, status, summary, harness transcript metadata, status events, output events, and normalized harness event payloads [@viewer_tests].

This keeps the viewer aligned with the public `jobs` control surface without giving it its own job state. The viewer can show what happened, but the run ledger remains the owner of lifecycle state.

## Browser Routing

The static viewer script keeps local UI state for the overview and selected repository [@viewer_js]. On startup it wires the search form, repository selector, and `hashchange` listener, then loads the overview and routes the current hash [@viewer_js].

Routes cover home, page, topic, search, file, jobs, and job detail [@viewer_js]. Repository changes clear job polling, reload the overview for the selected wiki, refresh navigation, and reroute the current hash [@viewer_js]. Navigation is built from topics and a folder-style page tree, so nested wiki paths appear as browseable folders rather than a flat page list [@viewer_js].

## Boundaries

The viewer is intentionally read-only. The architecture tests forbid mutating run request types such as `StartRunRequest`, `FinishRunRequest`, `QueueRunRequest`, and `CancelRunRequest` from the viewer service, viewer jobs projection, server app, and server API modules [@architecture_tests]. The same tests keep repository selection and projection logic outside `ViewerService`, so service methods stay focused on assembling viewer responses from existing read models [@architecture_tests].

Request validation keeps browser inputs inside the local wiki reference space. File routes normalize repo-relative file and folder references and reject paths that leave that space [@requests]. Server tests cover page, search, file, topic, jobs, registered-wiki switching, 404 mapping for missing pages, 422 mapping for invalid requests, static asset path rejection, and rejection of path-shaped run ids [@server_tests].

The result is a thin local viewer. It improves navigation and inspection, while the durable contracts remain in the index, run ledger, repository registry, and Markdown page format.

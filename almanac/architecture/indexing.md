# Indexing

The index is derived state. `src/codealmanac/services/index/schema.py` currently stores the database at `almanac/index.db` and recreates the derived schema through one migration version [@schema].

The schema includes pages, topics, page-topic edges, topic-parent edges, file references, page sources, page links, cross-wiki links, FTS5 content, and index metadata [@schema]. The projection deletes and rebuilds those tables from loaded page documents and topic definitions [@projection].

Page documents load title, summary, topics, sources, file references, page links, and body from Markdown files [@documents]. File references currently come from `sources:` and a legacy file-list parser; Ticket 3 removes that compatibility parser from the product path.

Health views read the derived tables to report graph and source problems [@health]. Ticket 6 turns that health surface into the public `codealmanac validate` command.

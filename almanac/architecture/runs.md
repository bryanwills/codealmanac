# Runs

`BuildWorkflow`, `IngestWorkflow`, and `GardenWorkflow` each prepare operation-specific context and delegate harness execution, run events, mutation safety, index refresh, and validation to `OperationRunner` [@operations] [@ingest] [@garden].

Operation prompts include a `source_control` context block that carries whether auto-commit is allowed, the wiki source files agents may commit, forbidden file categories, and the `almanac: <summary>` commit-message shape [@ingest] [@garden] [@commit-policy]. Queued runs store the target repository on the run record and persist the selected harness, inputs, guidance, and auto-commit flag in `RunSpec`; the worker restores that spec before running the operation [@queue] [@run-spec].

`OperationRunner` marks a run as running, records operation events, executes the selected harness, records harness transcript and harness events, validates mutation safety, refreshes the index, runs wiki validation, and finishes the run [@operations] [@validation]. This keeps harness plumbing out of individual operation workflows.

Mutation policy snapshots Git status before the harness runs and validates that files changed during the run stay under the configured `almanac/` root after the harness finishes [@mutation]. A run may start with pre-existing user edits in `almanac/`; the before/after comparison is what decides what the agent changed [@mutation].

The run store writes queued records, spec-backed queued records, events, harness transcript references, running transitions, terminal transitions, cancellation, and worker lock state in `~/.codealmanac/codealmanac.db` [@runs] [@local-state]. Per-repository runtime directories hold derived indexes, not run records [@local-state].

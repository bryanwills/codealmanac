# Harness Contract

The harness contract is the boundary between lifecycle workflows and external agent providers. Build, ingest, and garden send one normalized `RunHarnessRequest` to a selected harness and receive one normalized `HarnessRunResult` back. The workflows do not know whether the provider is Codex or Claude; that provider-specific behavior lives behind [provider adapters](provider-adapters) [@harness-ports] [@harness-requests].

The contract matters because lifecycle operations need stable facts after an agent run: readiness, terminal status, output text, changed files, transcript references, and normalized events. Those facts feed the [operation runner](../lifecycle/operation-runner), the run ledger, and user-facing job logs without leaking provider JSON streams into the rest of the system [@harness-results] [@harness-events].

## Adapter Shape

A harness adapter has one `kind`, a `check()` method, and a `run()` method [@harness-ports]. `check()` reports local readiness without starting an agent. `run()` executes one agent task and returns a normalized result [@harness-ports].

`HarnessesService` indexes adapters by kind, rejects duplicate adapters, and provides the single service entrypoint used by workflows [@harness-service]. Before running an adapter, it calls `ensure_ready`; unavailable harnesses fail early with a message that can include a repair hint and a command to switch to another registered harness [@harness-service].

The supported harness kinds are currently `codex` and `claude`. The terminal run statuses are `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled` [@harness-kinds].

## Run Requests

`RunHarnessRequest` is small on purpose. It carries the harness kind, model, working directory, prompt, and optional title [@harness-requests]. The prompt is already rendered by the lifecycle workflow before it crosses this boundary. That keeps prompt composition in runtime resources and operation workflows, while adapters focus on provider execution.

The request requires non-empty model and prompt text [@harness-requests]. A harness adapter may translate the request into provider options, CLI arguments, SDK calls, or app-server messages, but it must return to the same result model.

## Results

`HarnessRunResult` records the provider kind, terminal status, output text, optional summary, changed files, optional transcript reference, and normalized event stream [@harness-results]. The changed-file list is the critical bridge into mutation safety: lifecycle code can validate what the agent touched without knowing how the provider produced the edits.

Transcript references are represented by `HarnessTranscriptRef`, which stores the harness kind, provider session id, and optional transcript path [@harness-results]. This lets job views and later transcript sync connect an operation run to provider history without making every workflow parse provider storage directly.

## Events

Harness events form the provider-neutral event vocabulary for job logs and attach streams. Event kinds include text deltas, text blocks, tool use and result events, context usage, provider session announcements, warnings, errors, done events, and helper-agent lifecycle events [@harness-events]. The exact fields are defined in [harness event shape](../../reference/harness-event-shape).

Events also carry structured details when available: tool display data, token usage, provider ids, actor information, failure classification, and agent trace metadata [@harness-events]. This allows a Codex app-server notification or a Claude SDK message to become the same kind of log event before it reaches the rest of the product.

## Boundary Rule

The harness contract is a normalization boundary. Provider adapters may deal with CLI auth checks, JSON-RPC streams, SDK message classes, sandbox settings, and provider-specific failures. Service and workflow code should only depend on `HarnessReadiness`, `RunHarnessRequest`, `HarnessRunResult`, and `HarnessEvent` [@harness-service] [@harness-results].

That rule keeps adding a provider additive: implement the adapter, map provider events into the normalized event shape, report changed files, and register the adapter with the service. The lifecycle workflows should not gain provider branches.

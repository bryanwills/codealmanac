# Naming

Names are clear, simple, and product-oriented — words a user of the product would recognize, not developer jargon. One word is the ideal; two is acceptable; a compound noun that needs a comment to explain is a smell. A command "ingests material", it does not "execute an absorption pipeline".

Names must be honest. A file named `auth.py` must not secretly mean "Claude auth"; a central module must not know provider-specific details; a docstring that over-claims generality is a bug [@manual] [@claude-md]. If the honest name for a thing is awkward, the thing is probably shaped wrong — treat the naming difficulty as design feedback.

Naming is architecture: the moment a thing's general role can be named, it earns a first-class home at that name [@manual]. The reverse also holds — code that cannot be given a clear name has not found its boundary yet.

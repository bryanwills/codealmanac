# Source Provenance

`sources:` entries are the product evidence model for pages [@manual] [@ticket]. The parser accepts source types for files, web pages, commits, pull requests, issues, conversations, wiki pages, and manual pages [@frontmatter].

For file sources, the type-specific field is `path`; for web sources it is `url`; for commits it can be `commit`, `sha`, or `ref` [@frontmatter]. The parser stores a normalized `PageSource` value with id, type, target, title, retrieved timestamp, and note [@frontmatter].

Page loading turns file sources into file references for mention search [@documents]. The current loader also reads legacy file metadata until Ticket 3 removes that compatibility path [@documents] [@ticket].

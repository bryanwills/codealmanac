# Decisions

Decision pages record architectural choices that future work must respect or
explicitly supersede. The topic graph defines `decisions` as this repository's
neighborhood for choices that shape structure, workflows, and product surface
[@topics].

Read these pages before adding compatibility paths, lifecycle orchestration,
model selection behavior, page format changes, or root-selection behavior.

## Product Boundary

[Local-only Python product](local-only-python-product) is the base product
decision: CodeAlmanac is a local Python tool with repo-owned Markdown source
and machine-local runtime state [@local-only].

[Only Almanac root](only-almanac-root) narrows that shape to one wiki source
root: `almanac/`. It rejects `.almanac/`, `docs/almanac/`, custom roots, and
root migration shims as current product surfaces [@root].

## Wiki Format

[Markdown links and sources](markdown-links-and-sources) decides that page
navigation uses normal Markdown links and evidence uses structured `sources:`
entries with inline citations [@links-sources].

[No page-kind field](no-page-kind-field) decides that page type stays
expressed through folder placement and topics rather than a validated `kind`
frontmatter field, until a concrete behavior needs it [@page-kind].

## Lifecycle Execution

[No propose/apply or dry-run](no-propose-apply-or-dry-run) rejects lifecycle
proposal files, apply steps, dry-run rehearsals, and state machines between
writer and reviewer [@no-propose].

[Auto-commit is prompt policy](auto-commit-is-prompt-policy) decides that
auto-commit changes the instructions given to lifecycle agents; CodeAlmanac
does not stage, split, or commit wiki diffs itself [@auto-commit].

## Harness Models

[Controlled model catalog](controlled-model-catalog) decides that supported
runner models are owned by CodeAlmanac config and tests, not by provider
discovery or provider defaults [@model-catalog].

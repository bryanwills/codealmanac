# JSON Output Contract

`--json` is the machine-readable output surface for CodeAlmanac commands that support structured output. In JSON mode, renderers write JSON to stdout, usually with two-space indentation, while the command's exit code still reports success or failure [@common_render] [@cli_tests]. The JSON surface belongs to CLI render modules, which is why it is part of [Terminal output](../../architecture/cli/terminal-output).

The contract is command-specific. Some commands print Pydantic models through shared helpers; others print hand-built receipts with only the fields useful to scripts [@common_render] [@run_render]. Callers should treat each command's JSON shape as the stable unit, not assume a single global envelope.

## Shared Model Output

`print_json_model()` prints `model.model_dump(mode="json")` with indentation, and `print_json_rows()` prints an array of Pydantic model dumps [@common_render]. Renderers use this path when the service result is already the desired public shape.

`health --json`, `validate --json`, and `reindex --json` use structured model output through their renderers [@wiki_dispatch]. Tests assert that `reindex --json` includes fields such as `pages_indexed`, and that `health --json` includes graph findings such as `broken_links` and `target_slug` [@cli_tests].

## Command-Specific Receipts

Some JSON outputs are receipts rather than direct service model dumps. `init --json` prints repository name, wiki path, database path, indexed page count, run id, run status, and summary when present [@run_render]. Queued lifecycle runs such as `ingest --json` print `run_id`, `repository`, `runs_ahead`, `status`, and `child_pid` [@run_render].

`list --json` prints an array of objects. Each row contains a dumped `repository` object and a `status` value such as `available` [@repositories_render]. Tests assert fields including repository `name`, `almanac_root`, and row `status` [@cli_tests].

Other tested JSON surfaces include setup plans and results, update plans, doctor diagnostics, automation status, job logs, job lists, job cancellation, and health output [@cli_tests]. These shapes are owned by the renderers for those command families.

## Streams And Exit Codes

JSON output goes to stdout. Product and validation errors caught by `main()` still print text to stderr with the `codealmanac:` prefix and return exit code `1`, even when the user supplied `--json`; argparse syntax errors remain argparse errors [@cli_main] [@cli_tests]. See [Error and exit code contract](error-and-exit-code-contract) for the stderr and return-code rules.

`validate --json` is the main structured failure case. It prints a `ValidationResult` JSON object, then returns `0` when `ok` is true and `1` when `ok` is false [@wiki_dispatch]. Scripts should read both the JSON body and the process exit code.

## Commands Without JSON

Not every public command has `--json`. The parser exposes JSON flags only on selected commands, so commands such as `serve`, `tag`, `untag`, and topic mutation subcommands are human-output commands today [@parser_wiki]. The full supported command set is listed in [Public command surface](public-command-surface).

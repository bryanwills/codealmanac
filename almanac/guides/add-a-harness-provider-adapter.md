# Add A Harness Provider Adapter

Use this guide when CodeAlmanac needs to run lifecycle agents through a new provider. A harness provider adapter is the integration edge for an agent runtime. It checks local readiness, runs one normalized task, and returns a normalized `HarnessRunResult` with output, status, changed files, transcript metadata, and optional event stream [@harness-port] [@harness-results].

The goal is not to add provider branching to workflows. Build, ingest, and garden call the harness service through the shared [Harness contract](../architecture/agent-runs/harness-contract); provider-specific code lives under `integrations/harnesses/` and is registered at the [provider adapter](../architecture/agent-runs/provider-adapters) boundary. The normalized event shape is described by [Harness event shape](../reference/harness-event-shape).

## Add The Provider Kind

Every adapter has a `kind: HarnessKind` [@harness-port]. If the provider is new, add it to `HarnessKind` and update any public configuration or CLI choices that expose harness selection. `HarnessRunStatus` is provider-neutral and should stay limited to succeeded, failed, and cancelled unless the service contract itself changes [@harness-kinds].

Do not encode provider names in workflow logic. `HarnessesService` indexes adapters by `HarnessKind`, rejects duplicate kinds, checks readiness before running, and raises a clear error when the requested kind is missing or unavailable [@harness-service].

## Implement Readiness

Implement `check()` first. It should inspect local availability without starting an agent run [@harness-port]. The Codex adapter runs `codex login status`; the Claude adapter runs `claude auth status` and can fall back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` readiness [@codex-adapter] [@claude-adapter].

Return `HarnessReadiness(available=False, message=..., repair=...)` for missing binaries, timeouts, auth failures, or malformed provider status [@harness-results]. The service includes that message in run failures and, when alternatives exist, suggests switching the default harness [@harness-service].

## Implement Run

`run(request)` receives a `RunHarnessRequest` with the provider kind, model, working directory, prompt, and optional title [@harness-request]. The adapter should translate that request into the provider call, then translate provider output back into CodeAlmanac models.

Follow the existing provider shape. Both Codex and Claude snapshot Git status before and after the provider call, then return `changed_files` as paths added during the run [@codex-adapter] [@claude-adapter]. This lets lifecycle mutation safety validate what the agent changed without knowing provider details.

If the provider exposes structured events, map them into `HarnessEvent`. The event model covers text, tool use, tool results, usage, provider sessions, warnings, errors, done events, and helper-agent trace events [@harness-events]. Keep raw provider payloads at the edge as optional `raw` fields; do not make workflows parse provider transcripts.

## Register The Adapter

Add the adapter to `default_harness_adapters()` only when it should be part of normal app construction [@harness-defaults]. Tests can pass a narrow adapter list directly to `HarnessesService` or `create_app`, which keeps provider tests fast and local.

Registration should not add a dispatcher in the service. The service already selects by `HarnessKind` and calls the registered adapter [@harness-service]. If adding the provider requires a switch statement in a workflow, the boundary is in the wrong place.

## Verify The Change

Add service-level tests with a fake adapter before relying on provider integration tests. The existing tests prove that the service runs the registered adapter, refuses unavailable harnesses, reports readiness, handles missing providers, and rejects duplicate adapter kinds [@harness-tests].

Run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_harnesses_service.py
uv run pytest tests/test_architecture.py
uv run ruff check .
```

For provider-specific behavior, add focused tests beside the adapter. Avoid tests that require real credentials unless they are explicitly integration tests.

# Debug A Failed Lifecycle Run

Use this guide when build, ingest, or garden leaves a failed run. Start with
`codealmanac jobs`, then inspect `jobs show <run-id>` and
`jobs logs <run-id>`. The durable [run ledger](../concepts/run-ledger) keeps
the record and normalized event stream after the original process exits
[@repo-readme] [@run-store].

If the run is active, `codealmanac jobs attach <run-id>` follows the same event
record until it becomes terminal. The readable log is the primary debugging
surface; JSON output exposes the corresponding structured harness fields.
Pressing `Ctrl-C` while attached only detaches the foreground command; it does
not cancel or otherwise mutate the run, and the CLI prints the exact
`codealmanac jobs cancel <run-id>` command before exiting with status `130`
[@jobs-dispatch]. See [Run states and events](../reference/runs/run-states-and-events)
for the full attach and cancellation contract.

## Identify The Boundary

- Readiness or authentication failures appear before provider execution and
  include Yoke's repair message when available [@yoke-adapter].
- Provider failures and timeouts become a failed terminal harness event with
  structured failure details [@yoke-results].
- Tool and helper-agent failures appear in the preceding normalized events.
- Validation failures occur after a successful agent run when the resulting
  wiki source does not satisfy CodeAlmanac's product checks [@operation-runner].
- Indexing failures usually indicate malformed source or route collisions.

The operation runner records harness output before validating success, so the
event stream normally contains the provider evidence needed to distinguish a
Yoke/provider failure from a wiki validation failure [@operation-runner]
[@operation-harness]. Do not inspect deleted provider-specific adapter files or
infer failure state from assistant prose when a structured error event exists.

After correcting wiki source, follow [Verify A Wiki Change](verify-a-wiki-change).
After correcting credentials, installation, or provider configuration, run
`codealmanac doctor` and queue a new lifecycle run.

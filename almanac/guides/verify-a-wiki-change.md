# Verify A Wiki Change

Use this guide after editing wiki source under `almanac/`. A verified change has valid page links, usable source citations, no runtime-state files in the wiki tree, and a refreshed index that can represent the current Markdown [@health_service].

## Steps

Run `codealmanac validate` from the repository root. Validation checks source frontmatter shape, rejects runtime-state leaks, refreshes the index, and fails when graph or source-health issues remain [@health_service].

If validation fails, fix the reported wiki source issue rather than editing runtime state. Broken page links need a real target page or plain text. Missing citations need a matching `sources:` entry or a removed citation marker. Unused sources should be cited near the claim they support or removed [@health_page].

Use `codealmanac health` when you want the same graph report without treating it as a pass/fail gate. Use `codealmanac search`, `codealmanac show`, and `codealmanac topics` to spot-check that the page can be found and read through the public read surface [@repo_readme].

## Recovery

If validation reports runtime state under `almanac/`, remove that generated file from the wiki tree and keep runtime data under `~/.codealmanac/` [@health_page]. If validation reports route collisions, rename or move one Markdown page so each route maps to one file.

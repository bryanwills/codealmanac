# Guides

Guides are task procedures for maintainers who already know what outcome they
need. The topic graph defines `guides` as the task-oriented neighborhood, and
this hub groups the procedures by the work they unblock [@topics].

For background, follow the architecture or reference links inside each guide.
For exact command syntax or file formats, use [Reference](../reference/).

## Change Product Surfaces

[Add a CLI command](add-a-cli-command) covers command parser, dispatch, app
boundary, rendering, and tests for command work [@cli-command].

[Add a source runtime adapter](add-a-source-runtime-adapter) covers a new
source address and runtime loading path for ingest inputs [@source-adapter].
[Add a harness provider adapter](add-a-harness-provider-adapter) covers a new
local agent runner behind the harness contract [@harness-adapter].

## Debug And Operate

[Debug a failed lifecycle run](debug-a-failed-lifecycle-run) is the recovery
path for build, ingest, or garden jobs that fail through the run queue
[@failed-run].

[Setup local automation](setup-local-automation) covers setup, scheduler
entries, sync and garden cadence, update checks, and verification for local
automation [@automation].

## Maintain The Wiki

[Verify a wiki change](verify-a-wiki-change) is the shortest validation path
after editing wiki source [@verify-wiki]. [Maintain topics](maintain-topics)
covers topic creation, description, linking, renaming, deletion, and graph
checks [@topics-guide].

## Shape Future Work

[Refactoring boundaries](refactoring-boundaries) explains how to reshape code
around the repo's service, workflow, store, port, and integration boundaries
before adding behavior [@refactoring].

[Demo CodeAlmanac in a launch video](demo-codealmanac-in-launch-video) is the
product-demonstration guide for showing the local viewer and terminal query
flow in a launch video, including the broader product-story and comparison
framing behind that demo [@launch-demo].

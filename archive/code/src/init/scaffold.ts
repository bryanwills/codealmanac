# Codebase Wiki

This is the Almanac wiki for this repository. It captures the knowledge
the code itself can't say — decisions, flows, invariants, gotchas, incidents.

The primary reader is a new maintainer: a human joining the repository or an
agent starting with no prior context. Write pages as readable articles that are
also easy for agents to query, verify, and update.

## Where To Start

- Start with this page for the shape of the wiki.
- Read `_manual/README.md` before creating or reorganizing pages.
- Read `_meta/wiki-conventions.md` before changing local names, folders,
  topics, or recurring section shapes.

## Main Sections

- `concepts/` explains the vocabulary a new reader needs first.
- `architecture/` explains how the repository works.
- `guides/` explains common tasks.
- `reference/` records exact public contracts.
- `decisions/` records accepted choices and their rationale.
- `incidents/` records failures, migrations, and lessons that still matter.
- `active/` holds current investigations until they are folded into durable pages.
- `context/` holds product, market, competitor, and strategy background.
- `_manual/` defines how to maintain this wiki.
- `_meta/` records local conventions and coverage notes.

## Runtime State

Readable wiki content lives in `docs/almanac/`. Local runtime state lives in
`.almanac/`, including the SQLite index and job records.

# Wiki Manual

This manual defines how this codebase wiki should be written and maintained.
Read it before creating, moving, merging, or substantially rewriting pages.

The wiki should read like careful documentation for a new maintainer. It should
also remain queryable by agents through `page_id`, topics, wikilinks, source
records, and citations.

# Wiki Conventions

This file records local conventions for this repository's Almanac wiki. Update
it when the wiki develops naming, folder, source, citation, or linking rules
that future maintainers should follow.

## Starting Rules

- Use `docs/almanac/` for readable wiki content.
- Use `.almanac/` for runtime state such as `index.db` and jobs.
- Use `_manual/` for wiki doctrine and `_meta/` for local maintenance notes.
- Prefer stable `page_id` values so files can move without changing links.

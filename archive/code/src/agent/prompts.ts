/**
 * Loads bundled prompt text from the `prompts/` directory that ships with
 * the npm package. V1 prompts are split into shared base modules and
 * operation-specific instructions.
 *
 * ## Why not embed the prompts as TS string literals?
 *
 * The non-negotiable from the spec (see CLAUDE.md → "Non-negotiables"):
 * "Prompts are shipped from the npm package. They live in `prompts/` at
 * repo root, are bundled into `files` in `package.json`, and the agent
 * harness reads them from the package install path at runtime."
 *
 * Keeping them as separate files means they can be reviewed as prose,
 * diffed meaningfully, and (in the future) edited by users without
 * rebuilding the package.
 *
 * ## Path resolution
 *
 * Two runtime layouts need to work:
 *
 *   1. **Installed (`npm i -g codealmanac`).** The entry point lives at
 *      `dist/launcher.js`; prompts at `prompts/*.md`. Walking up from
 *      `import.meta.url` (`.../<pkg>/dist/launcher.js`) one level and
 *      into `prompts/` hits the right directory.
 *
 *   2. **Source dev.** During `npm run dev`, tsup emits to `dist/` just
 *      like in production, so case 1 applies. Tests import
 *      `src/agent/prompts.ts` directly via tsx/vitest; `import.meta.url`
 *      points at `src/agent/prompts.ts`. Walking up two levels from there
 *      lands at the repo root, where `prompts/` also lives.
 *
 * We probe a small list of candidates in order and use the first that
 * contains the required prompt files. This keeps a single source of truth —
 * the `prompts/` directory on disk — without baking in whether
 * we're running from `dist/` or `src/`.
